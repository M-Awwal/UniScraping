I also collaborate with material designers, long-term projects, commercialize key innovations, research fabric trends and new innovation offerings, provide technical assistance, collaborate with material operations and raw material sourcing, and serve as a primary category contact for material suppliers. At Bond, the assignments/ assessments definitely prepared me for what is expected in the real world and my responsibilities: I learnt team work, collaboration skills, meeting tight deadlines and making things happen. What I loved most about studying at Bond was the small class sizes, one on one guidance with the professors, accelerated learning, less vacation time and more time focused on completing your degree.

I wanted a degree where I had flexibility to study a range of both business and communications specialties that could provide me with a stronger skill set. I initially chose Bond University as I was awarded a Collegiate School Captain Scholarship mid-way through my final year at John Paul College, an opportunity I was thrilled to receive. I honestly loved my entire experience at Bond and could not recommend it highly enough to others. The opportunity to complete a degree in just two years is incredible and being so accountable means you’re not just a number. To put it into perspective, Bond allowed me the opportunity to finish my degree at 19 and officially graduate from my degree at just 20 years old. I really enjoyed the tutorial class sizes and experienced lecturers across all subjects. I love the location of Bond – heart of the Gold Coast which is such a beautiful place to live. Plus the campus was always in pristine condition. I met my best friend in the world at Bond – on our very first day! I clearly remember delivering the iconic toga speech under the arch for the core Public Speaking subject – that was both nerve-racking but confidence boosting.

I look after Regional Channel 9 Television advertising for a range of large scale media buying agencies.

Q: What inspired you to study a Bachelor of Communication (Business)? It was an excellent degree for me to do for my current business as communications is an important skill to develop – if you can’t communicate with people in business, you can’t do business with them. Working out how to identity the right markets, and what medium to use to make sure our business, Baildon Group, is successful is very important. Q: How did you balance your sporting career with study?I did Bond part time because I was swimming for Australia at the time. I graduated in 1995 and the following year I opened my first business. We now operate six businesses and have over 80 staff. We have three swim schools, a café and two Jetts gyms. It was really tough balancing swimming and studies because it draws out your degree, and particularly the people you establish close bonds with early on. I made some really close friendships, and they were gone after two or three years. I was happy I stuck with it though and finished it. Q: What attracted you to Bond? Don Watts, who was our inaugural VC at the time, was definitely the standout. He was responsible for building that real comradeship that we had among all the students at the start and really paved the way for the future of the University from my point of view. Sporting facilities were really great; swimming pool, wonderful gym, tennis courts, squash courts, we were overwhelmed with the facilities we had. It was my father who chose university for me at the time as I was just thinking I would swim and see how that went. That was a pretty ignorant way of thinking I guess, as a 16 or 17-year-old, but I was glad my father was a lot wiser than I was. I am very grateful to the people who have had an influence on my career and education at Bond. They really helped establish me in life and have given me the tools to continue to be successful. Q: What is your biggest career highlight? My highlights were winning Gold at the Commonwealth Games in 1990, being the first man to break 50 seconds and being the Australian Team Captain.

My time at Bond was absolutely incredible and definitely unforgettable. The friendships I’ve made through playing for the Bond University AFL Club, Sony Children’s Foundation, partying at Don’s Tavern and studying late at the Sustainable Development Building have made the experience the best it could ever be.

I can’t emphasize enough to students thinking about exchange, that the experience I had over in the US was something I’ll never forget.  I would highly recommend any student interested in applying, to just go for it.

Bond University takes success seriously and want their students to excel. It’s friendly and fun but still pushes you to try your best. I moved from Alice Springs at the start of 2017. It was a huge change from the Territory to the city but living on campus with other people in similar situations has made it much easier. I have continued horse riding once per week, visiting the beach, going to the university gym and exploring walking trails around the Gold Coast. The small class sizes and field trips ensure we get a more hands on knowledge and more of an idea of what to expect when we graduate. I have learned and experienced more practical and ‘real life’ knowledge. In addition, the class sizes have allowed me to ask questions to gain what I consider to be a deeper understanding of the content. I am currently doing a self-sourced Cadetship with Taylor Byrne Valuers here on the Gold Coast. I have been there since around August last year, working two days a week. I want to be a Certified Practising Valuer, training to, or working in, the specialisation of rural property valuation. Don’t let Bond’s highly regarded reputation deter you from seeking to apply.

The reasons why I decided to study at Bond was primarily because it combined both practical and theoretical components of learning, professors/ teaching staff were not only academics but also had relevant industry experience and Bond afforded the opportunity to complete two degrees in the time it would usually take to complete one. What I liked best about Bond University was the array of opportunities it provided. Not only were there academic opportunities, such as co-authoring articles with professors, there were also varied extra-curricular opportunities such as, being a part of student body groups, international moot court teams, participating in overseas charity work and studying abroad. I was lucky enough to take part in all of these activities, which enriched my time at university and prepared me for a career in law and criminological research. I currently work as an Associate at Edmonds Marshall McMahon LLP, a specialist private prosecution law firm in the United Kingdom. I am also a Research Associate at the White Collar Crime Centre United Kingdom. Prior to commencing my role as an Associate at Edmonds Marshall McMahon and Research Associate at the White Collar Crime Centre, I completed a Master of Philosophy in Criminological Research at the University of Cambridge.

I am currently employed by Queensland Corrective Services, in an Acting Senior Case Management Position. I have been employed there since March 2015. In my position I have a case load of high risk offenders which I manage. I supervise these offenders and assist them in a number or different ways, such as referring them to external agencies and addressing their identified needs. Other responsibilities include assessing risk on a day to day basis, writing reports within a timely manner and keeping detailed case notes following each interaction. Bond has helped me to fulfil these responsibilities by preparing me for this role. My degree taught me a lot about the criminology industry and my lecturers were integral to the successful completion of my studies, providing invaluable advice and guidance throughout. I enjoyed my experience at Bond University immensely. As criminology was an area I was so interested in, I gained so much more from my studies, and it was evident my lecturers were also passionate about what they were teaching. Through my internship organised by Bond, I was able to secure employment in my current position, which was the ideal outcome. I would happily recommend Bond to anyone considering study.

To this day, 10 years later, we are still best friends despite living in different countries. My Professors played an important role in my life as a student at Bond, and I am extremely grateful.

My Bond experience was one that I will treasure for the years to come. The various study facilities provided both the environment to complete work without distractions and the flexible hours to study in peace until the early hours of the morning. The student:staff ratio, consisting of small classes, allowed my cohort of 10 students to develop a strong bond. This resulted in both social and academic benefits, where we were able to assist each other throughout the year when needed. The open-door policy of the university allowed the opportunity to be mentored by lecturers and tutors on a weekly basis. I would highly recommend taking advantage of this student support provided by the academic staff as I believe I would not have been offered my current position without it. Although I have only studied at Bond until recently, I believe there is a difference between studying at Bond compared to other universities. Firstly, the facilities provided, the teaching quality and the student support at Bond University facilitate achieving academic success to allow students to obtain their career goals. Secondly, the networking opportunities and prestigious contacts available at Bond University further assist students to utilise their experience at Bond to fulfil their potential in their chosen industry. Finally, the culture produced from both the students and the academic staff at Bond create an environment that is enjoyable and supportive throughout the various challenges presented during the completion of a degree. I would definitely recommend studying at Bond for multiple reasons that I will reiterate. The small class sizes encourage student engagement. The accelerated degree process allows for career opportunities. The open-door policy includes mentoring by academic staff to achieve academic success. The various facilities at the university provide academic, social and health benefits. The work experience offered by the university as an addition to your degree or as a component of your degree place students at an advantage when applying for work and the networking opportunities available to students are beneficial for future career opportunities.""

I currently work as a Corrective Counsellor in Queensland Corrective Services at Wolston Correctional Centre. My main responsibilities are to follow up with prisoners when they request a psychologist/counsellor, interviewing new receptions coming into the Prison who have a history of self-harm and/or suicide, and to case manage prisoners who are subject to DPSOA’s (Dangerous Prisoner Sexual Offender Act). During my initial interview in Warwick, the representative spoke so highly of the University. My friend and I both applied and when we returned home we researched all we could about Bond. The amount of activities, facilities that Bond has to offer and the fact that they have real world lecturers, who work in their respective fields, is what influenced my decision. After I arrived at Bond I was not disappointed with my experience there! Bond certainly stood out for me. When I changed degrees, I could have gone to another University; however, I stayed at Bond. The connections that I made here I didn’t want to give up, and the fact that it’s a great University. Not only did I make connections with other students and guest lecturers, but also with the Bond lecturers, who I am still connected with to this day. They’re not only lecturers but they treat you like a friend, and that’s the reason I stayed, it felt welcoming. The programs at Bond also stood out because they are fast-tracked. I wanted to go straight into University, then to work and Bond allowed me to do a 4 year program in 2 years without a heavy workload; this then allowed me to pursue a career in my field earlier than I expected. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I loved everything about Bond! I stepped out and experienced all I possibly could, from, the plentiful parties, group gym classes, functions, club activities, open day, general activities run by BUSA (Bond University Student Association), the academics, sports teams, and heaps more. You can’t say that Bond is boring, there is something there for everyone; and the food is pretty good too! My experience at Bond was nothing short of amazing. I was living on campus for a year before moving off, which was probably the best thing to do so that I could adjust to the lifestyle. BUSA do their best to provide great functions, and activities to attend, and I would highly recommend, at least once in your time at Bond, to attend a party and make connections. The friends I made there are truly friends for life; I still talk to everyone including overseas students from Norway, France and America. I made connections with a few of the lecturers at Bond who were invaluable to my experience. Having the real-world lecturers also helped a lot as, with their experience, they could answer questions about what the field entails and what careers you can pursue with your respective degree. Bond encouraged me to step outside my comfort zone multiple times and I’m eternally grateful for the people that I’ve met along the way. I haven’t had the privilege of studying at other universities; however, my friends have stated that the classes are too large to be able to promptly ask for assistance or ask relative questions; that is why I appreciate how exclusive Bond is. I could ask my lecturer/tutor for help at a moment’s notice (when available), and my tutorial classes consisted of no more than 10 people, so discussions and questions during these classes were so beneficial. I would confidently recommend Bond 100%, and I would definitely study here again if I ever wanted a Postgraduate, PhD, or another Bachelor. The experience I took away from Bond was invaluable; I couldn’t have chosen a better place to study. Anyone who asks for my assistance on which University to study at, always gets my recommendation to Bond, I even convinced my cousin to study at Bond, and loved every minute of it!""
