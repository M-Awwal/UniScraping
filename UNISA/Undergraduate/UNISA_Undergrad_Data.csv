In Australia, growth in the pharmacy profession has been on the rise, with career prospects continuing to look very strong, having an expected 13,000 job openings over the next five years.1

The ability to work without supervision and with a high degree of accuracy under pressure is essential, as is a willingness to develop high-level problem-solving skills.
In addition, you should be motivated to take on an intellectual challenge, have a desire to gain expert specialised knowledge in your discipline, and a strong interest in research.  You will need to be meticulous, accurate and results-driven, and possess exceptional communication skills to manage interactions with patients and other professional.
With new therapeutic developments and expanding clinical roles pharmacists have more career options than ever before, which is great news for graduates.  
Pharmacists gain employment in:

hospitals
pharmacies
GP practices
community services
aged care settings
pharmaceutical industry
defence services
regulatory bodies
compounding or critical care services
infectious disease services 
academia and research.

As an honours student you may also choose to pursue a career in research – graduates with honours degrees are highly sought after by prospective employers, particularly within university and research settings. The Bachelor of Pharmacy (Honours) qualifies students for registration as a pharmacist, however, to become a practicing pharmacist, you will need to undertake the Pharmacy Intern Training Program at UniSA or another institution. 
Other postgraduate opportunities include the Master of Clinical Pharmacy.
