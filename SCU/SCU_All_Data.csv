	The Bachelor of Education (Honours) is a year of study that is undertaken following the successful completion of an undergraduate education degree. It enables students to:


		extend the depth of their education degree (as an expert educator)

		enhance their career pathways

		develop a basis for gaining entry into an education PhD program.


	The highest performing education students will be accepted to the Honours program. Upon successful completion, they will have an excellent chance of being admitted to a PhD program through the School of Education. Some Honours graduates may also be able to obtain scholarships for their PhD studies.

	The Honours degree includes units in educational research skills and research methodology that assists students to conduct a significant research project on a topic of their interest. Generally this research project will be presented in the form of a written thesis. A supervisor (an experienced academic) will closely guide and support Honours students in undertaking their research project (thesis) from concept through to completion. In all respects, Honours students in the School of Education will be regarded as budding researchers where they will contribute significantly to the research culture in the School.
