Systems Engineering Practice, which includes our Introduction to Systems Engineering course as the first three days, adds a two-day practical workshop that reinforces the material introduced in the introductory course.
In addition to providing further detail on the early stages of system design, Systems Engineering Practice presents a series of simulated design exercises that allow attendees to apply knowledge of systems engineering processes and management to a real-life system development. The exercise is conducted as a combination of tutorials and activities that step through the early system life cycle, focusing on Conceptual Design and Preliminary Design. Throughout the exercises, realistic development issues are introduced. To reinforce the understanding gained in this exercise, attendees undertake an individual design exercise.
No subject matter expertise is assumed—the exercises are conducted on a project with which all participants are familiar. The emphasis of the workshop is on the process rather than the technical detail.

The Introduction Course in November/December will run from Monday 23 - Thursday 26 November 2020.
  COURSE OVERVIEW
The two day RAM Introduction Course introduces students to the managerial considerations and requirements for producing a ‘reliable system.’ This course is primarily tailored for those who are new to the discipline but will help those who wish to develop their skills further. Members of ‘producer organizations’ (those who design and manufacture systems) and members of ‘consumer organizations’ (those who specify and purchase a system) will gain valuable insight on what they can do to get a more reliable system. The key focus is how reliability performance is ‘measured’ and how it relates to business outcomes … such as making money. Simple approaches for estimating the cost and benefit of a reliability activity are taught. Traditional reliability metrics (such as the MTBF) are examined – and in many instances shown why they are inappropriate for most reliability applications. The RAM Introduction Course teaches students how to go about initiating an organizational reliability plan, and considerations for implementing cultural change more broadly.
The RAM Introduction Course comprises the first two days of the five day RAM Management Course, which also includes our three day RAM Practitioners Course. The latter involves more practical reliability engineering skills that are used to implement a reliability plan.
No subject matter expertise is assumed.

COURSE OVERVIEW
The five day RAM Management Course, which includes both our RAM Introduction Course for the first two days and our RAM Practitioners Course for the last three, gives students an understanding of the key tenets of making a ‘reliable system.’ This course is primarily tailored for those who are new to the discipline but will help those who wish to develop their skills further. Members of ‘producer organizations’ (those who design and manufacture systems) and members of ‘consumer organizations’ (those who specify and purchase systems) will gain valuable insight on what they can do to optimize reliability.
The first part of the course focuses on ‘organizational management’ which is always the first step on the journey towards reliability maturity. The last part of the course focuses on ‘RAM practice’ that includes an overview of probability, statistics, test planning, key Design for Reliability (DfR) activities and several other related topics. This includes an exercise that 'investigates' a series of real-life reliability scenarios.
No subject matter expertise is assumed.

  COURSE OVERVIEW
The three day RAM Practitioners Course teaches students how to undertake some of the reliability activities necessary for producing a ‘reliable system.’ This course is primarily tailored for those who are new to the discipline but will help those who wish to develop their skills further. Members of ‘producer organizations’ (those who design and manufacture systems) and members of ‘consumer organizations’ (those who specify and purchase a system) will gain valuable insight on what they can do to get a more reliable system. The key focus is being able to understand the probabilistic nature of reliability performance, and analyse failure data to inform key decisions. This includes understanding key probability distributions (such as the Weibull distribution) and being able to use this knowledge to do thing like design reliability tests.
The RAM Practitioners Course comprises the last three days of the five day RAM Management Course, which also includes our two day RAM Introduction Course. The latter involves more organizational and management considerations for producing reliable systems.

Projects always involve uncertainties and understanding these uncertainties is crucial for developing adequate plan, which is required for effective project monitoring and control, and informed decision-making. Effective modelling techniques, which capture the complexities of projects and uncertainties involved, are therefore necessary for adequate project management. This course looks at those issues, describes existing models to deal with those issues and then discusses their merits and possible synthesis.
This course aims to provide an understanding of the processes, methods, and techniques used to model the project risks in particular schedule (time) and cost risks. Depending on where in the project life-cycle you apply it, this can help in advising senior management about project strategies and risks when applied in feasibility or requirement phase throughout project closure.

The success of projects and the project management team is often measured through achieving the targeted projects’ time, cost and scope which have been set or estimated during the initiation of the projects. Therefore, it is critical to know the basic knowledge, tools and techniques for developing a proper project scope, scheduling and budgeting that scope, and finally control that schedule and budget over time.  This course introduces attendees to the underlying principles and practice of managing project schedule and budget. It covers the body of knowledge needed for effective management of projects addressing techniques for project planning; project scheduling including critical path method, variations, and mitigation techniques; project budgeting including financial analysis; managing resources; project progress reporting and project control such as earned value management (EVM).
The course includes a number of practical exercises to reinforce attendees’ understanding of the relevant concepts and techniques and to allow application of the gained knowledge to real-life projects. The exercises are conducted as a combination of tutorials and activities that step through the various activities, focusing on schedule, resources and budgeting management for instance identifying and tracking critical path issues.  The course is ideally suited to those who are new to project scheduling, budgeting and control methods such as EVM—no prior knowledge or experience is assumed.

This five day course (being run over 4 long days for March 2018), extends on the advanced modern techniques for test design and analysis taught to systems engineers and project managers initially in foundational design of experiments (DOE) or design for six sigma (DFSS) either through the University of NSW’s masters subject (ZEIT 8034) or Air Academy Associates’ (AAA) Operational DOE course. Students who have been applying the basic test design and test analysis techniques to screen, model or validate system performance with packages like DOE PRO XL, SPC XL and rdExpert, will be introduced to more advanced functionality offered by Quantum XL and DFSS techniques to improve their test designing and analysis in the following areas:
Methods to build quality in from conceptual design through to service (house of quality)
How to optimise designs more fully, including operational models.
How to extract and use probabilistic transfer functions more fully
Expected value analysis (EVA) using Monte Carlo routines to estimate more precise confidence intervals of outputs
Using EVA to set more robust design inputs and allocate cost-effective tolerances for design or operations
Logistics regression techniques to better evaluate and predict from testing when outputs are binary like pass/fail, defeat/no defeat, decoy/no decoy, penetrate/no penetrate as used in electronic warfare, operational analysis and cybersecurity testing
Historical (big) data analysis techniques.
Case studies and practical workshops on the above.
Students who complete this course will be eligible in the following year to submit to a short examination and review of three case studies of their work by AAA in order to be Green Belt Industry accredited in DFSS techniques. This accreditation is well regarded in international industry.

Reviews:
“Excellent instructor for very tough subject, good interaction with class, great training materials, books, visuals, etc.”
“Overall, one of the very best training courses I have ever had.  Top notch instructor, presentation, and knowledge skills.”
“I really enjoyed the team interactions and the excellent instructor.  I have been to a number of courses and this has been my favorite in 10 years!”
“First course I have ever taken where exercises truly added to the understanding.  The most clear and meaningful presentation on process improvement I have seen to date.”
    ","WHO SHOULD ATTEND
This course is extremely valuable for acquisition and sustainment managers and systems engineers who do testing, evaluating or research on performance of systems. The course has been designed for professionals to apply test design and analysis using relatively simple modern packages that help assess performance of systems probabilistically (i.e., real systems). Attendees do need to have completed the foundation course by AAA or UNSW and practically applied those basic techniques to at least one system in their workplace or hobby.

This two-day course introduces advanced techniques for writing arguments and explanations that are well-reasoned, well-supported, psychologically-compelling and strategically-aligned with an organisation’s mission and priorities. The course uses argument mapping, deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning as tools for planning to write in the argument structure.
Four main features of this approach are brevity, clarity, readability and persuasiveness. These planning techniques encourage brevity, not by ‘dumbing down’ but by focusing in on what is logically-necessary and strategically-important. They achieve clarity by providing a structure that helps readers to understand the writer’s intent. Above all, they enhance persuasiveness by combining logical and psychological approaches to persuasive communication. Readability is also improved by applying some cognitive research findings on how readers read.","Who Should Attend:
This course is extremely valuable for managers, professionals and administrators in organisations. It is also useful to anyone who is required to explain or persuade, in writing. The course has been designed for university graduates and for experienced non-graduates who are required to write at an equivalent level. No academic or technical knowledge is assumed but the course can be challenging, in places
Participants are encouraged to bring along a piece of their own work-related writing to analyse and improve. This can be anything from a major report to a workplace email.",Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"COURSE AVAILABILITY

Public and private sector organisations engaged in commercial dealings need to have regard to many different facets of the law and be conscious of how the law impacts on their operations and relationships with other entities, including suppliers of goods and services. The risk of protracted and expensive disputes, or even litigation, for organisations that do not give adequate consideration to contract law is real and requires effective management.
This course is designed to provide an exposure to, and understanding of, the legal framework and principles of law surrounding the formation and enforceability of contracts. The course examines the essential areas of contract law (formation, interpretation of terms, lack of true consent, termination, breach and remedies) as well as other related topics such as tenders and the legal management of disputes. No prior legal knowledge is required to undertake this course and it is assumed participants do not have a formal legal background. It is taught in a way that explains the law in a manner most readily grasped by non-lawyers.","Who Should Attend:
Anyone requiring an understanding of contracts and the legal rules that underpin them, including: business managers; project managers; risk managers; procurement staff; capability management staff; and any person involved with the negotiation, management and enforcement of contracts. The course is of particular interest to members of the Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group.

As the world’s problems, both private and public, become more complex and more global, decision analysis has an increasingly important role to play to help decision makers gain a greater understanding of the problems they face and the environment in which those problems must be addressed. The objective of Decision Analysis is to provide one with the understanding and tools of decision analysis to make one a better manager. Understanding, together with supporting data, information, and knowledge, is essential to support one in decision making and problem solving in the present dynamic world of globalization, multi-national corporations, and technological innovation. To gain that understanding, one needs to know how to frame the right question, how to develop an appropriate model or paradigm to analyse the problem, evaluate the different solution alternatives, so that one can make the right decision at the right time.  This course aims to make decision analysis more understandable and therefore become more accessible for potential decision makers.
This course is divided into two modules over 5 days as follows.
Module 1: Basic Decision Analysis (3 days)
Module 2: Advanced Topics in Decision Analysis (2 days)
Module 1 + Module 2: Advanced Decision Analysis
 The participants can do either Module 1 or both Modules. However, Module 1 is a prerequisite for Module 2","Who should attend:

Effective policy design, implementation and evaluation requires consideration of the whole, often complex, system under consideration.  Being able to maintain a view or understanding of the whole is a recognised challenge, often discussed when researching wicked or complex problems. This masterclass will explore the hopes and realities when developing effective policy responses in complex systems, through the lens of complexity-informed public management. It will provide the latest thinking on how complexity-informed public management can be planned, implemented and evaluated.  The leadership and performance management approaches which will inspire and bring together those from across a policy system are presented and discussed.
This masterclass will explore a range of tools used to support the design, implementation and evaluation of interventions designed to shape the structure of complex systems to drive particular outcomes.
The course will enable policymakers and practitioners to ask questions like:
Design: How can policies most effectively address ongoing and complex problems through targeting specific pattern breaking interevention points?
Implementation: How can understanding systems enable the implementation of policies be effectively tailored to the dynamics of particular contexts?
Evaluation: How can we assess the systemic impact of particular interventions and their interactions with the contexts in which they are deployed?","Who Should Attend?

Presenting data to senior decision-makers, management boards, and stakeholders is typically a daunting task, as it requires both expertise in handling large amount of information as well as highly developed communication skills to summarise and show effectively key analytical results. This short course trains you in becoming an effective communicator by making use of data to summarise, present or reinforce results and conclusions arising from the data at hand. The course does not require any prior expertise, as it will cover the ground up from basic principles in organising and displaying information as well as examples of effective communication in a variety of settings. The course covers key techniques used in producing various types of graphs to summarise information and display basic relationships between variables of interest. The course is highly applied and relevant work examples are used.
Basic data handling. This module outlines introductory skills in data including data type, acquiring/sourcing/finding data fit for a purpose, fundamentals of data organisation in graphs and tables, and foundational statistics. The goal of this module is to introduce participants to essential data literacy concepts, be able to find relevant data or suitable alternatives, read data using basic descriptive statistics (mean, range, median, mode, etc.) and present the data in a way conducive to storytelling using basic summary statistics, table and figures/charts.
From data to story and from story to data. This module focuses on preparing, or ‘cleaning’, data for analysis, and introduces fundamental strategies for identifying and visualising relevant data. Learners will filter, group, and aggregate data, describe relevant data for the purpose of analysis, apply descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation) to tables and charts (bar, line, histogram, scatter plot) to improve the key message to be communicated. Both approaches of developing a story from data, and using data to communicate effectively the content of a story are reviewed.
Advanced data analysis. This module focuses on data analysis including key statistical tests, correlation and linear regression and t-tests, to visualise correlational and causal data relationships.
Communicate effectively with data. This module focuses on using a variety of techniques to visualise data to generate and communicate insights for decision-making. It will also present examples of effective narrative using data analysis.","Who Should Attend:

The 70:20:10 framework is widely used across the Australian public sector to assist organisations to develop capability.  Although the framework is popular and well regarded, there is little research into its effectiveness.  Researchers from the Public Service Research Group have spoken with 145 public sector managers to understand the effectiveness of middle management development programs aligned to the 70:20:10 framework.
During the program, we will share the findings of our research and offer recommendations to improve the return on investment and transfer of learning from management and leadership programs to the workplace, through a more effective use of the 70:20:10 framework.
At the end of the masterclass, participants will gain a better understanding of:
the experiences of middle managers attending development programs;
what is and what is not working well in management and leadership development;
the ideal training that public sector managers seek;

PG,University of New South Wales Canberra at ADFA,Canberra,Crafting conversation to create high performance: A Masterclass,Humanities and Social Science,845,845,AUD,Course,1,Days,Yes,No,,,,,,,https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/study/professional-education-courses/crafting-conversation-create-high-performance-masterclass,English,A,"Course Overview:
It is widely accepted that to achieve organisational high performance, individuals must be performing at their best. A major contributor to individual performance is the presence of regular and effective performance conversations. Such conversations should enable individuals to understand their purpose within the organisation, giving both goal and role clarity. This will necessitate managers clearly articulating their expectations of their team members.
This two day masterclass is designed for those who undertake performance conversations as a core component of their roles. We will consider alternative forms of conversation and discuss why recognising and utilising different conversational forms helps to create new patterns of behaviour and performance outcomes. The core principles of expectancy theory are considered when using these conversational forms, giving participants the opportunity to develop ideas for future approaches to managing expectations.
At the end of the masterclass, participants will:
Have insight into the impact of conversations and how actively managing expectations can create high performance;
Recognise a range of conversational forms and how they may be applied to create change or influence others;
Be able to use a range of conversational forms to plan and implement high performance.
  Masterclass format:
This experiential masterclass will give participants an opportunity, in a safe space, to consider different types of conversations, learn about expectancy theory, gain some key lessons and undertake practical techniques designed to make “changing the conversation” a reality. 
Drawing on recent research and practical knowledge, this interactive masterclass will consider how diverse conversational forms create different outcomes. It will also consider how this learning can be used in conjunction with the principles of expectancy theory to affect individual behaviour, thereby creating different outcomes. Presenters will work with participants to consider how these lessons can be applied in their own organisations and managerial practice.

Integrated care is a global phenomenon across developed and developing countries seeking to make health and care systems both co-ordinated and person-centred.  Australia is no exception to this, with the Productivity Commission’s recent Productivity Review highlighting the creation of integrated care as a key priority.  The arguments for integration are many – ageing demographics, increasing complexity of conditions, continued health inequalities and poor patient experience - with health and care services struggling to collaborate successfully across organisational and sectoral boundaries. Successfully addressing fragmentation in pathways, practice and purposes would potentially improve outcomes and make services more effective and efficient.
The common building blocks of a more integrated system are well recognised – stratification to help target resources, multi-disciplinary teams to bring together professionals, new roles to address delivery and co-ordination gaps, and purchasing for population level outcomes. Delivering these in practice and at scale and evidencing that expected impacts have been achieved requires constructive leadership and sustained interest. This masterclass will explore the hopes and realities of integrated care through the lenses of policy, research and practice. It will provide the latest thinking on how it can best be planned, implemented and evaluated and the leadership approaches which will inspire and bring together those from across a health and care system. Delivered by researchers with international reputations in the fields of integration, collaboration and leadership it will provide a challenging and interactive masterclass.","Who Should Attend:
The workshop will be relevant to those who have an interest and/or role in developing integrated care within their health and care system.

This two-day course introduces advanced techniques for writing arguments and explanations that are well-reasoned, well-supported, psychologically-compelling and strategically-aligned with an organisation’s mission and priorities. The course uses argument mapping, deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning as tools for planning to write in the argument structure.
Four main features of this approach are brevity, clarity, readability and persuasiveness. These planning techniques encourage brevity, not by ‘dumbing down’ but by focusing in on what is logically-necessary and strategically-important. They achieve clarity by providing a structure that helps readers to understand the writer’s intent. Above all, they enhance persuasiveness by combining logical and psychological approaches to persuasive communication. Readability is also improved by applying some cognitive research findings on how readers read.

CBA is one of the methods used to evaluate value for money for new projects or a regulatory change. If the sum is positive, the benefits exceed the costs and the project should be undertaken as it increases efficiency and value to society. If it is negative, the opposite conclusion arises. This course is aimed at managers needing to understand workings and limitations of CBA rather than fostering technical expertise for specialists already carrying out CBA analyses in their everyday work. As such the course highlights the functioning of CBA, its weaknesses, and the ‘grey areas’ that may be overlooked but have substantive impact on the final result. This course uses real examples and is designed to be interactive.
The course is organised around 10 modules of about 1-1.5 hours each over two days covering the rationale and key components of CBA as well as its step-by-step application using specific examples. Topics include:
•           The structure of CBA reports
•           What should and should not be included in CBA?
•           Which methodology to apply when targeting efficiency vs. value for money
•           Estimating benefits: which approach?
•           ‘Seeing” a CBA through a spreadsheet
•           Sensitivity analysis: a key step to understand drivers of benefits and costs
•           Key weaknesses for using, or abusing, CBA
  Course material: references and handouts will be distributed to students prior to the course.
Prerequisites: none. Some working knowledge of Excel is useful but not essential.","Who Should Attend:

At a time when the Australian Defence Force is moving to a fifth generation of technological capability and Australia is embarking upon a massive naval shipbuilding program as part of that evolution, the need in government, industry, academia and the media to understand the way that maritime warfare works has never been greater. Yet the basic concepts are often opaque to outsiders, with even the simplest elements often surrounded by a mass of jargon and acronyms.
This one-day course is designed to provide a first introduction to the way in which navies conduct warfare at sea by providing clear and simple explanations of how navies operate in high and low intensity conflicts.
After starting with expositions of the roles and functions of navies and the way in which naval forces are structured, the course will explain the influence of the environment above and below the water on sensors and weapons. It will set out the inherent capabilities and limitations of surface, underwater and airborne platforms and show how they interact. It will cover emergent technologies and show the way in which warfare at sea will change as a result of their influence.
The formal lectures will be followed by an interactive ‘tactical floor’, during which the course will be led through a multi-dimensional maritime operation. This ‘directed war game’ will consolidate the learnings from the earlier presentations by giving a practical insight into the way in which war at sea is conducted, showing both its opportunities and its risks.
Learning outcomes: By the end of the day, course members should possess a basic understanding of naval operations and the tools to seek further knowledge of this complex, but critical subject.

In contrast to most Australian managers’ belief, Business Excellence (BE) is not a generic concept like customer satisfaction or business improvement. It has its own tools for assessment and specific methods and models for implementation. BE models are capable of quantifying the excellence of organisations regardless of their size and industrial sector.
In more than six decades since its birth, BE has achieved glorious results. BE has been supported and recommended by several long-standing corporations, such as Nestle, KLM, BMW, TNT, Electrolux, Philips, Daimler-Chrysler, Siemens, Bosch, etc. BE has also been identified as the motivating force for Japanese post-war industries. Most importantly, several authors have found that companies that implement a BE model, outperform other companies.
By the end of this course, through seven highly engaging workshops, participants will be able to demonstrate the importance of the Business Excellence and explain its fundamental concepts and criteria defined by the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM). Participants will also have a good understanding of the steps involved in implementing Business Excellence self-assessments and improvement programs.
The following questions are addressed in this course:
Where does the Business Excellence originate from, and how has it evolved since its birth?
What are the major Business Excellence models and what are their differences?
What are the fundamental concepts for the EFQM Business Excellence Model?
What are the criteria and sub-criteria for the EFQM Business Excellence Model?
What is the scoring logic for the EFQM Business Excellence Model?
What are the required steps for a successful business excellence self-assessment and improvement?
What are the existing Business Excellence self-assessment methods and how can we recognise the most suitable method for a certain firm?
