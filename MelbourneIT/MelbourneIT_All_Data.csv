In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..

In this unit to facilitate thorough understanding of consumer behaviour, we will explore models and frameworks of consumer decision-making, and the effects that various internal drives and external influences have on our actions and decisions. In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..

Customer motivation and consumer perception

In this unit to facilitate thorough understanding of consumer behaviour, we will explore models and frameworks of consumer decision-making, and the effects that various internal drives and external influences have on our actions and decisions. In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..

In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..

In this unit to facilitate thorough understanding of consumer behaviour, we will explore models and frameworks of consumer decision-making, and the effects that various internal drives and external influences have on our actions and decisions. In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..

Consumer attitudes

In this unit to facilitate thorough understanding of consumer behaviour, we will explore models and frameworks of consumer decision-making, and the effects that various internal drives and external influences have on our actions and decisions. In this increasingly competitive world of business it has never been more important to attain an in-depth understanding of consumer behaviour - a complex multi-faceted field of study which provides real insights that can be practically applied in marketing to gain competitive advantage. While we are all consumers in day to day life, few of us fully understand the internal and external mechanisms driving us to behave in certain ways and make specific buying and consumption decisions - what drives us to study, to our choice of car, to body art or even to socially undesirable behaviours such as compulsive gambling? Are our decisions impacted by internal drivers or by forces in our external environment such as family and culture? In reality it is often a combination of these influences, thus it is important to understand not only where those influences are coming from, but also how they interact with each other to result in consumer decisions..
The unit topics include:
Customer motivation and consumer perception
Consumer attitudes
Consumer decision making process
Consumer diversity
Consumer psychographics
