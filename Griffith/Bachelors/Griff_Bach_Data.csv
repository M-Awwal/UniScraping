You’ll study some of society’s most  intriguing issues along with the techniques to analyse them and devise  break-through solutions. You’ll be equipped to combine your hard knowledge of  world issues with advanced data analysis techniques. You’ll develop the  knowledge to select the appropriate tools and methodologies for the issues  you’re working on, along with the communication skills to collate and present  your findings to decision-makers, to enable evidence-based solutions that can  positively transform society. Climate change is an example of a contemporary  challenge that can’t be solved by 'pure' science alone. Solutions will come  from people who can not only interpret the data but also understand the need  for social impact studies, policy development, and effective public  communication. Social scientists work in these intersecting spaces, which is  why they are in high-demand across government departments, creative industries,  political parties, the business sector, in think tanks and non-government  organisations (NGOs). You don’t need prior knowledge of statistical  research methods as you’ll study core courses that will develop your skills in  analysing social policy and data, along with your two majors. Each of the  majors represents a different perspective on the challenges of the future and  allow you to develop areas of expertise that can open doors to a broad  range of careers. There are also opportunities to undertake an internship in an  area of your interest, and join a global study tour. You can choose two of the following majors: Economics: If you want an expert insight into why the  Australian dollar fluctuates or what caused the Global Financial Crisis, this  major is the ideal choice. You’ll gain an understanding of the big financial  issues facing societies and learn how governments make decisions about what to  spend on complex issues such as the environment, healthcare, infrastructure and  resources. You’ll also learn how markets work, and how businesses make  decisions about pricing, staffing and responding to competition. Environmental Sustainability: Environmental sustainability is the world’s  biggest issue. This major is not about the ‘hard science’ of the environment,  but instead explores the key social and policy issues behind the need for  sustainable management of our planet’s finite resources. In this major you’ll  study environmental politics, climate change policy, the economics of natural  resources, and environmental ethics and culture. Global Security Threats: If you’re interested in developing  future-focused solutions to some of the world’s most complex challenges, this  major is for you. You’ll be exposed to a stimulating array of international  issues, including conflict and forced displacement, terrorism and political  violence, Islam-West relations, cybercrime, energy security, and the  environment. You'll gain a critical understanding of underlying causes, underpinned by a foundational course in World History. Media, Communication and Social Change: In the information age, the ways we  communicate - and are communicated to - are diverse and ever changing. The ability  to understand and manipulate communications is crucial to creating change. Producing, interpreting and analysing communications are not only  desirable skills, but fascinating areas of study. This major covers such topics as, the power of mass and social media, journalism, public  relations, discourse analysis, new communication technologies, political spin, and the global spread of English. Politics in Asia: This major harnesses Griffith’s  internationally recognised strengths in politics and Asian studies. You’ll  develop a deep understanding of the political, cultural, economic and social  dimensions of the Asian region.  Topics include the rise of China, global security, the interconnection of  business and politics, the role of international organisations, and Australia’s  place in the region. Social Justice: This major is for those who are motivated by the fundamental question, ‘What makes a fair society?’ and are passionate about  fighting for a better world. Social justice refers to the idea that all people  deserve equal and fair opportunities and treatment. By specialising in this  area, you’ll explore contemporary hot topics such as human rights, indigenous history  and disadvantage, gender and crime, domestic violence,  youth justice, power and politics and the administration of the law.","Economics: You will be prepared for work in government,  NGOs, the finance sector or large business organisations. You’ll be equipped to  take on roles analysing and interpreting the interaction between markets, the  environment, the health sector, transport, financial policy developments and  decision-making, and the impact of global conditions on the national economy. Environmental Sustainability: You will be prepared for work in  environmental science communication, environmental management and planning,  policy development, environmental sustainability advocacy (in agriculture,  industry, and natural resources), social and economic environmental impact  analysis, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Global Security Threats: You will be prepared for work as an analyst,  community advocate, liaison or leader, policy developer (in analysis and  evaluation), research officer, corporate strategy officer, or risk adviser. Media, Communication and Social Change: You will be prepared for work as a  communications officer, social policy researcher, speech writer, media liaison,  public relations consultant, social media analyst or other roles where you’re  required to analyse, evaluate and interpret communication strategies or writing  across diverse genres and on various platforms. Politics in Asia: You will be prepared for roles that provide  advice to government, business leaders and NGOs in areas such as Asian economic, environment and social  policy, regional relationships, regional development, Asian political  structures, East-Asian political economy and trade relations.

This double degree is ideal for those students who are interested in developing hands-on practical  skills in designing and making dentures, crowns and bridges, combined with diagnosing, designing and fitting removable dentures directly to patients. For secondary school leavers, it will provide opportunities for specialisation and more opportunities for employment upon  graduation. Students graduate with two qualifications to be able to work as both a Dental Technologist/Technician and Dental Prosthetist. Dental Technologists (or Dental Technicians as they are often referred to) are highly skilled members of the dental team. They combine art and science skills to construct custom-made dental devices such as dentures, crowns, bridges and orthodontic appliances to replace, restore and correct defects that may affect our facial appearance and the ability to use  our teeth properly. They generally work behind the scenes in laboratories and not directly on patients. Dental Prosthetists work independently in a clinical setting to diagnose and treat patients requiring removable partial or full dentures. The first three years will be spent developing highly specialised hand skills, finishing with a professional practice course where students work alongside dentistry students on ""real-life real-time"" patient cases. The final fourth year builds on the previous years with a focus on developing clinical knowledge and skills to diagnose, fabricate, make and fit dentures directly to patients. A number of key benefits set Griffith's Dental Prosthetist education apart from that at other teaching institutions. Students develop advanced critical analytical skills to solve difficult technical and clinical situations. They learn in an inter-professional environment from experienced Dental Prosthetists and specialists in fields such as: Dental Prosthetic students practice alongside Dentistry students to develop communication and  collaboration skills in individual cases. This may include, for example,  inserting and monitoring immediate dentures or witnessing a variety of complex  dental procedures. This process is managed through the Team-Based Treatment  Planning Process which develops patient referral skills.","With this qualification graduates will find employment opportunities in the public and private health sectors through government health department clinics and private practice as a Dental Technician/Dental Prosthetist or Clinical Dental Technician. Dental Technologists (or Dental Technicians as they are  often referred to) will find employment with Dental Technicians, Dentists,  Dental Prosthetists, Prosthodontists, Orthodontists, Periodontists, and Oral  Surgeons in the public or private health sectors working to referring dental  practitioners and specialist's prescriptions. Graduates will be able to design and construct oral devices according to international standards that meet  individual patient's needs. Dental Technicians work with a wide range of  materials and techniques such as: gold, porcelain, plastic and lost wax technique and CAD-CAM (Computer Aided Design/Manufacturing). They may see patients to record the colour, shape and characteristics of existing teeth. With this qualification, graduates can apply technical skills, scientific knowledge, artistic skills and compassionate nature across three distinct specialist areas - Prosthodontic, Conservative and Orthodontic - or you may eventually choose self-employment. Graduates will be well equipped to sit for a 'skills exam'  requested by employers. Prosthodontic Technician and Clinician (Removable Prosthodontics)
Dental Prosthetists work directly with patients to provide removable partial dentures and will also design and fabricate full and partial dentures in plastic or alloy. Graduates will be well equipped for the variety of procedures and techniques to replace missing teeth and will work alongside dentists and prosthodontists. A student graduating as a dental technologist and dental prosthetist can potentially have two income streams.

The course will introduce some elements of behavioural sciences and game theory applied to business problems. It will also tackle some of the critical questions around the use of information for business decision making: how to assess the validity/reliability and relevance of the information we receive? how to use it effectively? how to simplify information, make it relevant, and present it to different audiences? The course combines different aspects. First, it encourages students to account for the psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural, and social factors that affects decisions made by individuals and organisations (e.g. private corporates, government, civil society, etc). Second it provides simple analytical tools to contextualise strategic decision-making in real world situations through lenses such as that of the consumer and the future role of social marketing. Third, it introduces students to the idea that business decision making requires reliable, timely information. The course takes a positive (as opposed to normative) approach to the analysis of interactive strategic decisions and behaviours. Through case studies, the course provides a description of what happens in a variety of business situations, with a focus on understanding the elements/dynamics that leads to a certain outcome of decision. In so doing, the course helps students identify the role of information (qualitative or quantitative), how it is sourced and assessed in terms of its validity/quality, and how it can be used to deal with uncertainty in decision-making. Basic approaches to the analysis, interpretation and presentation of various types of information are also discussed, including the foundations of big data analytics and qualitative data analysis.",FOUNDATION MATHEMATICS,,"Foundation Mathematics aims to provide a solid basis from which to build a wider set of mathematical skills across a broad range of disciplines.
