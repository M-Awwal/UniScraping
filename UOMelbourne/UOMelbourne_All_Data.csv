Undergraduate course applications must be submitted via VTAC.Agriculture’s focus on science and sustainability is how we will adapt to our changing climate, declining environmental health and increasing demand for safe food production to feed our growing populations.BE IN DEMANDA Bachelor of Agriculture is your opportunity to use science, technology and business to tackle critical sustainability issues and build a career with lasting impact.If you’d like to understand how to harness natural processes to sustainably feed our growing population, improve natural resource management and contribute to Australia’s growing agricultural industry, the Bachelor of Agriculture is an ideal choice. Graduates with a degree in agriculture are highly sought after in Australia, with an employment rate of over 92 per cent.You’ll learn the science necessary to produce safe, high-quality and ethical food and fibre as well as the economics underpinning Australia’s important role in international trade. Australia is a major global supplier of agricultural goods – around $40 billion of Australia’s projected $60 billion of agricultural production in 2019–20 will be exported.LEARN IN THE LAB AND THE FIELDAn agriculture degree lets you apply biology, chemistry, physics, and economics and see the real-world results of your actions. Whether you start your post-university career in a laboratory, on farms or in a bank, you’ll be making a real impact on the world. You’ll complement your lab and classroom learning with fieldwork, and you can even choose to spend a semester learning at our agricultural research and teaching campus at Dookie, giving you additional hands-on experience and knowledge of farm operations.APPLY THE LATEST TECHNOLOGYAgriculture is at the beginning of a technological revolution, with research by Melbourne academics playing a leading role. Drone-based sensors can monitor plants for disease and water stress across areas equivalent to hundreds of football fields in under an hour. ‘Big data’ and machine learning will give you tools to help farmers grow more food while reducing agriculture’s environmental impact. Study the science and economics underpinning these innovations and enter the workforce ready to contribute to sustainable and profitable agriculture.IMPROVE CROP AND ANIMAL HEALTHPlants and animals provide more food and fibre when we protect their health and welfare. Our academics determine the best ways to maintain the welfare of farm animals, develop diets to help livestock thrive in hot and dry conditions, discover the origin, spread and effects of disease and develop new medicines. Our scientists are using precision gene-editing tools to develop crops that can survive disease, drought and heat. Develop an understanding of plant and animal health and welfare to prepare you for a career in the agricultural industry or for further study in veterinary medicine.MAKE OUR FOOD SUPPLY SUSTAINABLEFarmers manage 48 per cent of Australia’s landmass, and each year, on average, an Australian farmer will feed 600 people. But in a changing climate, we need to maintain a healthy environment, too. Benefit from the knowledge and expertise of our researchers as they find ways to make farming more drought-resilient, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve soil health and re-use waste while producing high-quality food. You’ll learn how to monitor and optimise the transfer of nutrients from soils to plants to animals and how to make land and water use more sustainable by applying agricultural science and economics.Pathway into the Bachelor of AgricultureStudents who complete the Diploma in General Studies pathway program will be eligible for substantial credit towards their Bachelor of Agriculture degree.","With essential input from industry experts and employers, the Bachelor of Agriculture will prepare you for a range of career options with global, sustainable impact.As populations increase and climate change affects agriculture and the natural world, healthy, economically viable and sustainable food and fibre production is quickly becoming the most pressing issue of our time.Our graduates find work all along the value chain of agriculture and its supporting industries and agencies in Australia and around the world, in roles involving:Sustainable practiceWater management improvementResponsible fertiliser useOn-farm advisingFood and fibre production increaseDisease-resistant crop developmentAnimal welfareBiosecurityPost-farm processing and marketingAgribusiness management and agricultural financeGovernment and industry policy.In recent years, our graduates have joined employers including Agriculture Victoria, NAB, ANZ, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, Fonterra, Murray Goulburn, Warakirri Cropping, Rural Bank, Rabobank, Stock and Land, BASF and Perfection Fresh.Have you thought about these career paths?BUSINESS, BANKING AND FINANCEAgricultural business must balance the need for environmentally safe practice with economically sound models. Professionals in this area combine agricultural science and economic knowledge to deliver tailored solutions to challenging issues. You can go on to advise agribusinesses on financial planning as a finance officer, analyse market conditions as a commodity trader or determine the viability of new markets or products as a sales and marketing manager.ANIMAL PRODUCTIONTo feed our human population, we must take care of our animal population. Animal production management, from genetics and reproduction through to nutrition, disease control, behaviour and welfare, are vital to global health. Improve growth and productivity as an animal nutritionist, enforce laws and educate the public as an animal health or welfare officer, or maintain biosecurity and prevent a potentially devastating disease outbreak.AGRONOMYAs the effects of global warming become more intense, you could make a real difference by improving the use of plants for food, fuel, fibre and land reclamation. Increase production output, preserve water efficiency, maintain soil nutrition and maximise the yield of farming lands by working in plant genetics, plant physiology and soil science.POLICYAgricultural science also applies to the social science of food and production. Apply your understanding of agriculture to advise government and industry bodies on the most effective and balanced way to regulate and prioritise agriculture policy.INTERNATIONAL AIDAs climate change exacerbates the occurrence of natural disasters around the world, understanding people, culture and landscape will assist vulnerable communities to become more resilient. Aid organisations need agricultural specialists who can help these communities by improving their agricultural profitability and teaching them skills to become more resistant to threat in the future.Further study and research for a competitive edgeA graduate degree can be a life-changing option. You’ll be equipped with specialised cognitive and technical skills and an internationally recognised graduate qualification, setting you apart from those who study a traditional Australian single or double degree. In Australia, students with a graduate degree earn more, too – on average, 36 per cent or more than $22 700 more per year^.Embark on your research journey through an honours year or a research higher degree with one of the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences’ leading researchers supervising your project. Work with laboratories and institutes around the world to advance our understanding of issues such as climate change, food security and conservation biology, to name a few. A fourth honours year draws together your previous studies and focuses your knowledge, skills and intellect on a piece of original research. Honours can further prepare you for employment, or for a higher research degree like a PhD.GRADUATE STUDY IN VETERINARY, AGRICULTURAL, AND FOOD SCIENCESGraduate study areas include:Agricultural sciencesAgribusinessAgricultural extension and innovationAnimal scienceCrop productionFood sustainabilityFood and packaging innovationFood scienceVeterinary medicineIf you have completed the Production Animal Science major and have achieved high average marks, you can even apply to study the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine with up to 25 points of credit.^Quality Indicators for Learning and Teaching, 2018 Graduate Outcomes Survey",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,

For children to be active, contributing citizens, they need relational teaching that focuses on social issues relevant to their context and local communities. In Australia, early childhood teachers have a responsibility to value and promote greater understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing and being, as is set out in the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), Victorian Early Years Learning and Development Framework (VEYLDF), Australia’s Education and Care Services National Law, and the National Quality Framework.Relevant to all communities, on both a local and global level, is sustainability. Understanding and acting on sustainable practices empowers children to build deep relationships with local places, including the waterways, landforms, plants, animals, and insects they inhabit the planet with. Early childhood teachers who understand the need for these relationships create learning and teaching moments that respond to social issues and contribute to making a meaningful, positive impact on the world.Alongside the importance of teaching that centres these commitments, there is a growing need for bachelor-qualified early childhood teachers in Victoria to meet requirements introduced by the Department of Education and Training (DET), and the continual need for early childhood teachers across Australia.The Graduate Diploma in Early Childhood Teaching focuses on learning and teaching for children aged birth to eight years, providing the required qualification for registration to teach in early childhood settings from birth to age five.Taught by internationally-recognised scholars at The Melbourne Graduate School of Education (MGSE), the online course is a radical re-thinking of how we become, belong and be as teachers in the context of our relationship with Country and Indigenous Worldviews.It focuses on foregrounding Indigenous Worldviews and sustainability to equip you to foster a learning environment that values and promotes inclusivity, respect and sustainability for the growth of all children.

Undergraduate course applications must be submitted via VTAC.Is this you?Are you interested in discovering the next generation of treatments to help improve the health of your community?Does the science behind what creates, sustains and threatens people’s lives intrigue you? Can you see yourself studying and working in the largest biomedical precinct in the southern hemisphere?Whether you want to pursue a career in medicine, professional health, biomedical research or another pursuit – a Bachelor of Biomedicine can take you there. The integrated curriculum emphasises the relationship between the biomedical science disciplines that underpin modern clinical practice and prepares you for the challenges of contemporary health delivery and research.Key FeaturesUndergraduateThe Bachelor of Biomedicine just got better. At the undergraduate level, the Bachelor of Biomedicine is ideal preparation for a career in medicine and professional health. While doing the Bachelor of Biomedicine has never been a compulsory or privileged path to the Doctor of Medicine (MD), it’s a good strategy – especially when you’re following your passion. The recently announced changes to the MD curriculum1 make this strategy more salient by providing you with a firm foundation in biomedical sciences. Find out more about these changes.The Melbourne Medical School (MMS) aims to recognise prior knowledge for core content. So, if you’ve studied the Bachelor of Biomedicine this frees you up so that you’ll have more time to explore the clinical, research and discovery tracks and create your own distinct path. You’ll be able to take full advantage of the innovative MD curriculum by jumping higher and faster.The MMS is also removing prerequisite subjects as selection criteria for entry into the Doctor of Medicine2. This further diversifies the MD cohort to reflect the multiplicity of doctors required in society. It removes any disadvantage students may have in accessing science and health subjects in their previous degrees, especially in rural areas. Most medical degrees at Australian universities do not require prerequisite subjects as an entry requirement, allowing students to study the undergraduate degree that suits them best. The new Melbourne MD entry requirements will still involve MMI, GPA and GAMSAT components. The Bachelor of Biomedicine offers a proven foundation to address these requirements.TeachingAward-winning teachers, many of whom are also researchers or clinicians, inspire the next generation of biomedical professionals. Students are empowered to think conceptually about the problems affecting global human health. Teachers of the School have received the prestigious David White Award for teaching three times, along with other University and national awards for program innovation, excellence in engagement and outstanding contributions to student learning.OutcomesThe University is proud to be ranked number one in Australia for Graduate Employability.*The Bachelor of Biomedicine has the flexibility to deliver a range of outcomes. Students are more frequently selected into the Melbourne Medical program than those from any other program in Australia. Others follow pursuits such as dentistry, biomedical research or bioengineering, and a small but growing number combine the degree with graduate law, commerce or management.PrecinctImagine studying or working in the largest biomedical precinct in the southern hemisphere. More than 40 hospitals, research, teaching and biotechnology organisations surround the School of Biomedical Sciences – making it a highly sought-after base for global biomedical leaders.

It also develops skills that enable clinical researchers to undertake their own research. Graduates are expected to:Understand the epidemiological and biostatistical theory and methods that underpin epidemiological practice and research with a solid foundation in epidemiological and analytical skillsBuild competence in critical appraisal, and develop core skills for research and practice in epidemiologyInvestigate and describe the causes and spread of disease and develop the means for prevention or controlThe project may involve a student analysing existing data, performing a systematic review or developing a research protocol, allowing further development in a specialty interest area of the student’s choice according to methods, disease groups and/or population setting.Course descriptionThe Master of Epidemiology lays a solid foundation in epidemiological, analytical and critical appraisal skills used in clinical and epidemiological practice and health research.To be eligible, you need an honours degree, a medical degree, or a 3-year degree with relevant work experience.  Students in this program are typically practising clinicians (e.g. doctors) who are looking for the equivalent of a one-year degree or students who have been working in the health sector and who eventually want to do a PhD based on epidemiological research.Two of the core subjects are offered in online mode only, while other subjects are offered in dual delivery mode: online and on-campus. Some subjects are semester long, others run for shorter periods.Choosing between the Master of Epidemiology, Master of Science (Epidemiology) or Master of Public Health specialising in Epidemiology and BiostatisticsStudents wishing to specialise in Epidemiology have three options:Master of Epidemiology (MEpi)Master of Science (Epidemiology) (MSci (Epi))Master of Public Health (MPH) specialising in Epidemiology and BiostatisticsHow long are the courses?The MPH is a two year-full time course (200 points), although it is possible for students to be offered up to 50 points credit, making it equivalent to 1.5 years full-time.  The MSc (Epi) is a two-year full-time program (200 points).  The MEpi is a two-year part-time program (100 points); it is not available for full-time study.What are the differences in the entry requirements?Applicants for the MPH and MSc(Epi) must have a 3-year undergraduate degree.  Any degree is acceptable for the MPH, whereas applicants for the MSc(Epi) must have a science major.  Because the MEpi is equivalent to a one-year masters degree, applicants for this program must have at least an honours degree, a medical degree, or a 3-year degree with at least two years relevant work experience.What are the main differences in the structure of the courses?The MPH is a broad degree that includes a diverse range of subjects relevant to the practice of public health.  It has six compulsory subjects (including Epidemiology and Biostatistics) and many electives from which to choose.  It includes an optional, 25-point research project or an optional, 25-point professional practice unit.The MEpi has five compulsory subjects and one elective subject in epidemiology and biostatistics and a compulsory 25-point research project.   The entry requirements are stricter than for the other two degrees because it is a one-year program.The MSc(Epi) has six compulsory subjects in epidemiology and biostatistics (five of which are the compulsory subjects for the MEpi). Students in the MSc(Epi) must also do at least two subjects designed to improve their professional skills.  The degree has a compulsory, 50-point research project.  It offers more opportunity for elective subjects than the MEpi.Can I do the same epidemiology and biostatistics subjects in each degree?Depending on how many points you do for your MPH, you can include all the epidemiology and biostatistics subjects that are part of the MSc (Epi). You can do six of these subjects for the MEpi.What type of students are the degrees designed for?The MPH is a broad degree that is internationally recognised as suitable for public health practitioners.  It is available to anyone with a 3-year degree in any field of study.  The MPH is probably the most suitable degree for you if:You are interested in the practice of public health, but want good skills in epidemiology and biostatisticsYou have no background in public health or science, but are interested in developing skills and knowledge in public health (and want good skills in epidemiology and biostatistics).  The combination of these subjects will help you to explore your career options in public health in practice or epidemiological research.  Students in the MPH come from many backgrounds and the MPH is suitable if you are not sure if epidemiology is the career path for you.The MEpi is designed for students to want to increase their research skills in epidemiology with the aim of either contributing to epidemiological or medical research or developing a research career, but who don’t want the breadth of subjects required for the MPH.  To be eligible, you need an honours degree, a medical degree, or a 3-year degree with relevant work experience.  Students in this program are typically practising clinicians (e.g. doctors) who are looking for the equivalent of a one-year degree or students who have been working in the health sector and who eventually want to do a PhD based on epidemiological research.The MSc(Epi) is designed for students coming from a science background who want to become epidemiologists.  It allows more flexibility than the MEpi because it is a two-year program.  It is available to anyone with a 3-year degree in a relevant science discipline and thus allows people without an honours degree the possibility of in-depth study in epidemiology.  Most of the students in this program come straight from a 3-year undergraduate degree with the aim of developing a career in epidemiology.Can I use each degree as a pathway PhD?Yes.If you do the MPH, you would need to do the research project or have already completed the equivalent of 25 points worth of research to be eligible for a PhD.If you do the MPH, and you want to do a PhD in epidemiology, you would be advised to do most, if not all of the epidemiology/biostatistics subjects.","Graduate attributesThe Melbourne Experience enables our graduates to become:Academically excellent:have a strong sense of intellectual integrity and the ethics of scholarshiphave in-depth knowledge of their specialist discipline(s)reach a high level of achievement in writing, generic research activities, problem-solving and communicationbe critical and creative thinkers, with an aptitude for continued self-directed learningbe adept at learning in a range of ways, including through information and communication technologiesKnowledgeable across disciplines:examine critically, synthesise and evaluate knowledge across a broad range of disciplinesexpand their analytical and cognitive skills through learning experiences in diverse subjectshave the capacity to participate fully in collaborative learning and to confront unfamiliar problemshave a set of flexible and transferable skills for different types of employmentLeaders in communities:initiate and implement constructive change in their communities, including professions and workplaceshave excellent interpersonal and decision-making skills, including an awareness of personal strengths and limitationsmentor future generations of learnersengage in meaningful public discourse, with a profound awareness of community needsAttuned to cultural diversity:value different culturesbe well-informed citizens able to contribute to their communities wherever they choose to live and workhave an understanding of the social and cultural diversity in our communityrespect indigenous knowledge, cultures and valuesActive global citizens:accept social and civic responsibilitiesbe advocates for improving the sustainability of the environmenthave a broad global understanding, with a high regard for human rights, equity and ethics",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,

It shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques and an awareness of their limitations. The thesis also makes a distinct contribution to knowledge. Its contribution to knowledge rests on originality of approach and / or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, the discovery of new facts. The thesis demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the professional arena and in an international context. It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work demonstrating that a research 'apprenticeship' is complete and the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline.In scope, the PhD thesis differs from a research Masters thesis chiefly by its deeper and more comprehensive treatment of the chosen subject.
