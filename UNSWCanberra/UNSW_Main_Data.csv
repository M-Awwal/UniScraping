The Chief of Defence Force Honours Program in Engineering offers the opportunity for students entering UNSW Canberra with a high Entrance Rank, and who maintain a high level of performance in their studies, to undertake research in a range of disciplines that will develop their critical thinking and independent research skills beyond that available in the standard Engineering program.
In Year 1 of the program students will be engaged with cohort activities so as to develop and maintain their interest and continuing involvement in the program via invited lectures, seminars, general reading and social events.
Commencing in Year 2, the research projects, each offered as separate courses, will be supervised by academic staff from the same or closely related discipline. Students in the research courses may work independently or as part of a team, depending on the nature of the project undertaken, though all students will submit individual assessment. Final assessment, due by the end of semester, will be based on a written paper and an oral presentation.
The Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Aeronautical Engineering is of four years duration, and the degree may be awarded at Honours Class I, Honours Class II, Division I or Honours Class II, Division II. These Honours levels will be displayed on the final testamur. Candidates who do not achieve Honours Class 1 or 2 will receive a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (CDF) in Aeronautical Engineering with no honours level displayed.
The Program is accredited by Engineers Australia.

The Bachelor of Arts degree enriches your understanding of how human beings make, and debate life’s meaning and values. Students develop their capacity for critical analysis and argument as well as an awareness of the value of language as a political, intellectual, creative and communicative tool.
The diverse range of courses and electives form pathways for majors in:
Business
The study of business explores key management skills and gives a sophisticated knowledge of strategy, leadership and other managerial concepts through the study of economics, accounting, management and human resources.
English and Media Studies
How does language persuade and move us? How does culture respond to or imagine war? Students complete their studies in English with a sophisticated knowledge of both the world’s literary heritage and their own contemporary culture, from the classical heroic epics to contemporary social media.
Geography
Geography is the study of both the physical and human environments in which we live and the interactions between people and nature. Geography provides a bridge between the social and natural sciences and gives students the techniques to analyse our environment and society, including using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing.
History
History seeks to understand individual and group behaviour and to explain the forces that have shaped human civilisation: social change, wars, revolutions and popular movements. Historical analysis examines the relationships between past events and the present. The student of history learns how to assimilate and weigh evidence, analyse problems and balance different points of view in the context of the past and of the present.
Indonesian Studies
Indonesia is one of Australia’s most important neighbouring countries. Indonesian Studies gives you the ability to read, write, speak and understand standard Indonesian, and will also give you a broad understanding of Indonesian society and culture. No prior Indonesian knowledge is required.
International and Political Studies (IPS)
IPS involves the study of power and norms in a rapidly changing global environment. It covers the major factors, ideas and key issues of domestic, regional and global politics, international relations and ethical thought, all of which have a profound impact on Australia’s national security and its place in the world.
Key features:
– You have a choice of majors within a BA degree.
– UNSW Canberra’s Academy Library Special Collections are of national significance, including over 300 manuscript collections, 13,000 rare items and the papers of former Prime Minister John Howard.
– UNSW Canberra has the best university teacher-to-student ratio in Australia.

If eligible, students who have completed the pass degree, may be admitted to an additional one-year Honours program.
  This program is built on solid computer science and mathematics fundamentals with a focus on both theoretical foundations and practical approaches to computation and its applications within security. In this program, students first apply these techniques to gaming and then later learn more about hardware, systems, networking and the Internet, and learn to secure such environments.
  The design methods, tools and programming ability gained can be applied to many kinds of computer applications. In a final-year capstone team project students will be able to select from a wide range of ADF and civilian application domains in which to develop these abilities in computing and cyber security.
Students will use state of the art equipment in all their security and forensics courses in a Cyber Range.
Pass-level students in Computing and Cyber Security should complete their programs within three years. Eligible and approved Honours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets can continue with their programs at the end of the third year. Army officer cadets, however, at the end of their third year transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

Middle managers are recognized as a key element of organisational change, but despite this the majority of courses offered by universities do not focus on the specific people challenges of middle managers. This online program balances advanced theory with practical knowledge, offering the opportunity to develop strategy implementation plans which effectively integrate and utilise the people involved. Underpinned by relevant research at UNSW Canberra the program will enable more successful incorporation of  human resources into strategic plans and the achievement of desired organisational outcomes.
The program is designed for postgraduate scholars and professional managers with appropriate undergraduate qualifications in management or a related discipline and/or extensive relevant professional experience wishing to gain a more advanced understanding of the concepts and principles that underpin strategic people management and effective leadership. The program includes optional research project courses, which enable students to produce a substantial piece of research-based scholarship during their degree. The program will develop  critical thinking, problem solving, research and systems analysis skills in order to improve team effectiveness, as well as to meet the challenges of complex contextual and organisational demands. Key aspects of the program are to understand aspects of the organisational system and how to work within that, to recognise the meaning of the wider organisational strategy and to develop implementation plans that will create an appropriately skilled workforce that has clarity as to their role and performance requirements.

The Doctoral degree is formal recognition of successful research experience. The candidate must make a distinct and original contribution to knowledge. Considerably more original work is required for a Doctorate than for a Masters research degree. The nature and level of supervision will evolve over the duration of the candidature. The work will be more closely supervised in the early stages. In the later stages, however, the candidate must be allowed increasing scope to exercise initiatives and demonstrate originality.
In the latter part of the program the candidate should be able to work alone and be guided rather than directed by the supervisor. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy requires a minimum of three years full-time study and preparation of a thesis. The length of a doctoral thesis normally should not exceed 100,000 words of text.",,Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"Program Code: 1203
