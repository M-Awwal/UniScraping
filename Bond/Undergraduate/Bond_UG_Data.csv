The professors were always willing to help, guide, support and provide pathways and opportunities to get you to where you wanted to be. Bond University provided that wealth of knowledge, that entry into the world of enterprise and a get-up-and-go confidence to achieve lifelong ambitions. This institution enables students to thrive in a community that builds self-assurance and prepares for the real world. My time at Bond was absolutely incredible and definitely unforgettable. The friendships I’ve made through playing for the Bond University AFL Club, Sony Children’s Foundation, partying at Don’s Tavern and studying late at the Sustainable Development Building have made the experience the best it could ever be. I thoroughly enjoyed my time and love all the opportunities Bond presents to the students. As it’s quite a small campus compared to other universities you really feel like its home when you’re on campus. I couldn’t speak more highly of my time at Bond University and recommend it to any students considering studying. During my time at Bond University I worked for Herron Todd White Property valuers as an assistant valuer. This experience was invaluable. As well as completing my degree, my day to day work in the real world would directly correlate to what I was learning at University which enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of my subjects. I was also fortunate enough to go on exchange as the first ever Bachelor of Property student to Clemson University in South Carolina. It was tricky at first to find subjects that would relate and be recognised in relation to my degree. However the staff who work with securing students’ subjects to enable them to organise exchange, were extremely helpful. Together we were able arrange the two core subjects that were sufficient as accreditation for my degree at Bond and the other two were my electives which I had saved for an opportunity like this. I can’t emphasize enough to students thinking about exchange, that the experience I had over in the US was something I’ll never forget.  I would highly recommend any student interested in applying, to just go for it. Planning is the key. Going on exchange for a Property student is more difficult, however if you are organized with your subjects and plan out the structure of your degree so you can finish in the timeframe that you wish. I guarantee that it’ll be an experience that you’ll never forget. In my current position, as Commercial Banking Assistant Relationship Manager (Property Development/ Investment), my responsibilities include: valuation methodology, analyzing credit risk, operational risk, documentation and settlement functionality, assisting in managing a portfolio which is predominantly Property Investment/ Development. Bond has helped me prepare for these responsibilities by presenting similar tasks for assignments, speeches, exams and oral presentations. Bond University provided numerous networking events so that you could speak to other Bond Alumni who were already in the industry and gain insights from their experiences.  Bond has an impressive Alumni program that allows students to call and contact professionals who are already in the industry and gain advice/ be mentored. It is these extra opportunities and the personalisation of the programs that makes Bond University stand out in a crowd. Bond draws a critical mass of students from all over Australia and Internationally. I am born and bred on the Gold Coast, however Queenslanders were the minority on campus. Bond University is a melting pot of international and interstate students, all brimming with enthusiasm and open to the opportunity to mix study and career, friendship and fun. Thanks to Bond University, I have friends all over the country and all over the world.   I loved the size of the campus and the personal touches Bond University brings.  It is easy to become highly engaged in your classes and build great relationships with both your peers and your professors.  It is the Bond University way. I applaud Bond University and I am so grateful that my choices led to studying at this wonderful institution. I am proud to be a Bondie and I am appreciative of the ‘bonds’ that Bond University embraces and offers. Through all the academic pursuits, social events, sporting teams, study groups, networking events and opportunities, the University never disappoints.  I’ll never forget my time at Bond and can clearly endorse just why it is rated as Australia’s No. 1 university for student experience.""

It was a huge change from the Territory to the city but living on campus with other people in similar situations has made it much easier. I have continued horse riding once per week, visiting the beach, going to the university gym and exploring walking trails around the Gold Coast. The small class sizes and field trips ensure we get a more hands on knowledge and more of an idea of what to expect when we graduate.

The reasons why I decided to study at Bond was primarily because it combined both practical and theoretical components of learning, professors/ teaching staff were not only academics but also had relevant industry experience and Bond afforded the opportunity to complete two degrees in the time it would usually take to complete one. What I liked best about Bond University was the array of opportunities it provided. Not only were there academic opportunities, such as co-authoring articles with professors, there were also varied extra-curricular opportunities such as, being a part of student body groups, international moot court teams, participating in overseas charity work and studying abroad. I was lucky enough to take part in all of these activities, which enriched my time at university and prepared me for a career in law and criminological research.

My degree taught me a lot about the criminology industry and my lecturers were integral to the successful completion of my studies, providing invaluable advice and guidance throughout. I enjoyed my experience at Bond University immensely. As criminology was an area I was so interested in, I gained so much more from my studies, and it was evident my lecturers were also passionate about what they were teaching.

The various study facilities provided both the environment to complete work without distractions and the flexible hours to study in peace until the early hours of the morning. The student:staff ratio, consisting of small classes, allowed my cohort of 10 students to develop a strong bond. This resulted in both social and academic benefits, where we were able to assist each other throughout the year when needed. The open-door policy of the university allowed the opportunity to be mentored by lecturers and tutors on a weekly basis. I would highly recommend taking advantage of this student support provided by the academic staff as I believe I would not have been offered my current position without it. Although I have only studied at Bond until recently, I believe there is a difference between studying at Bond compared to other universities. Firstly, the facilities provided, the teaching quality and the student support at Bond University facilitate achieving academic success to allow students to obtain their career goals. Secondly, the networking opportunities and prestigious contacts available at Bond University further assist students to utilise their experience at Bond to fulfil their potential in their chosen industry. Finally, the culture produced from both the students and the academic staff at Bond create an environment that is enjoyable and supportive throughout the various challenges presented during the completion of a degree.

The accelerated degree process allows for career opportunities. The open-door policy includes mentoring by academic staff to achieve academic success.

During my initial interview in Warwick, the representative spoke so highly of the University. My friend and I both applied and when we returned home we researched all we could about Bond. The amount of activities, facilities that Bond has to offer and the fact that they have real world lecturers, who work in their respective fields, is what influenced my decision. After I arrived at Bond I was not disappointed with my experience there! Bond certainly stood out for me. When I changed degrees, I could have gone to another University; however, I stayed at Bond. The connections that I made here I didn’t want to give up, and the fact that it’s a great University. Not only did I make connections with other students and guest lecturers, but also with the Bond lecturers, who I am still connected with to this day. They’re not only lecturers but they treat you like a friend, and that’s the reason I stayed, it felt welcoming. The programs at Bond also stood out because they are fast-tracked. I wanted to go straight into University, then to work and Bond allowed me to do a 4 year program in 2 years without a heavy workload; this then allowed me to pursue a career in my field earlier than I expected. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I loved everything about Bond! I stepped out and experienced all I possibly could, from, the plentiful parties, group gym classes, functions, club activities, open day, general activities run by BUSA (Bond University Student Association), the academics, sports teams, and heaps more. You can’t say that Bond is boring, there is something there for everyone; and the food is pretty good too! My experience at Bond was nothing short of amazing. I was living on campus for a year before moving off, which was probably the best thing to do so that I could adjust to the lifestyle. BUSA do their best to provide great functions, and activities to attend, and I would highly recommend, at least once in your time at Bond, to attend a party and make connections. The friends I made there are truly friends for life; I still talk to everyone including overseas students from Norway, France and America. I made connections with a few of the lecturers at Bond who were invaluable to my experience. Having the real-world lecturers also helped a lot as, with their experience, they could answer questions about what the field entails and what careers you can pursue with your respective degree. Bond encouraged me to step outside my comfort zone multiple times and I’m eternally grateful for the people that I’ve met along the way. I haven’t had the privilege of studying at other universities; however, my friends have stated that the classes are too large to be able to promptly ask for assistance or ask relative questions; that is why I appreciate how exclusive Bond is. I could ask my lecturer/tutor for help at a moment’s notice (when available), and my tutorial classes consisted of no more than 10 people, so discussions and questions during these classes were so beneficial. I would confidently recommend Bond 100%, and I would definitely study here again if I ever wanted a Postgraduate, PhD, or another Bachelor. The experience I took away from Bond was invaluable; I couldn’t have chosen a better place to study. Anyone who asks for my assistance on which University to study at, always gets my recommendation to Bond, I even convinced my cousin to study at Bond, and loved every minute of it!""
