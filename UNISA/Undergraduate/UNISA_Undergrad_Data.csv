Midwives are the primary maternity care providers in Australia, providing care, support and advice to women during pregnancy, labour, birth and postnatally. They play an important role in the promotion of normal birth, which includes screening, assessments, detection of complications, and providing emergency care to both the woman and her baby in collaboration with other health professionals. Midwives play a significant role in health education such as family planning, preparing for birth, parenting and infant care.
Registered midwives can work in a wide variety of settings, such as:

community services
public or private hospitals
rural and remote healthcare
home-based services
health agencies
midwifery education
research.

As a Midwife, you may also have the opportunity to undertake further study in the areas of research with a Masters by Research or strengthen your supervisory skills with a Graduate Certificate in Health Science (Clinical Education) or Professional Certificate in Practice Education. Other options are the Graduate Certificate in Perinatal Mental Health and the Master of Midwifery.

As an honours student you may also choose to pursue a career in research – graduates with honours degrees are highly sought after by prospective employers, particularly within university and research settings. The Bachelor of Pharmacy (Honours) qualifies students for registration as a pharmacist, however, to become a practicing pharmacist, you will need to undertake the Pharmacy Intern Training Program at UniSA or another institution. 
Other postgraduate opportunities include the Master of Clinical Pharmacy.

Case studies demonstrate the concepts and principles of sustainable development and how they might be incorporated in national and international development projects.","Economic development has, in recent times, been achieved at the expense of degraded natural systems, diminished resources, changes to the climate, loss of biodiversity and increased health risks from pollution. Sustainable Development (SD) is a key challenge for the present generation so that its needs can be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The solutions are complex and will require coordinated interaction by governments, local communities, business, institutions and non-governmental organizations.

Depending on your primary chosen stream, human movement graduates will be able to consider careers such as:

Sport Development Officer: responsible for coordinating club and athlete participation in sports programs, as well as improving the performance of individuals and teams
Community and Allied Health Worker: support and assist the work of allied health professionals, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists and dieticians
Health and Wellbeing Advisor: provide advice on healthy active lifestyles and nutrition to support wellbeing
Human Movement Practitioner: engage a broad population of people and groups throughout the lifespan to be more physically active using a broad range of modalities for health, fitness and wellbeing
Outdoor Education Practitioner: facilitate nature-based outdoor learning experiences for personal and group development, health and wellbeing, environmental learning, sustainability and social justice
Sports Coach: provide expert training advice to sporting professionals, and analyse their performances to provide further feedback and development strategies.

Those students in the Health and Physical Education stream can continue their studies with the Master of Teaching (Secondary), leading to teach Health and Physical Education (up to Year 12) or Junior Science (up to Year 10), in addition to a third learning area depending on your elective choices whilst studying human movement. For more information including subjects you'll be able to teach, visit our secondary health and physical education teaching page.
Students in the Exercise and Sport Science stream are eligible to apply for accreditation and registration as an Accredited Exercise Scientist through Exercise and Sport Science Australia (ESSA), as long as you have completed the required hours of practical experience. 
Become even more employable by combining your Bachelor of Human Movement degree with another degree. With just one year of extra study you can graduate with a double degree in Nutrition and Food Sciences.
Other postgraduate coursework areas include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, business, social work, primary teaching and research.

Midwives are the primary maternity care providers in Australia, providing care, support and advice to women during pregnancy, labour, birth and in the postnatal transition. They play an important role in the promotion of normal birth, which includes screening, assessments, detection of complications, and providing emergency care to both the woman and her baby in collaboration with other health professionals. Midwives play a significant role in health education such as family planning, preparing for birth, parenting and infant care.
Registered midwives can work in a wide variety of settings, such as:

community services
public or private hospitals
rural and remote healthcare
home-based services
health agencies
midwifery education
research.

As a Midwife, you may also have the opportunity to undertake further study in the areas of research with a Masters by Research or strengthen your supervisory skills with a Graduate Certificate in Health Science (Clinical Education) or Professional Certificate in Practice Education.

As a Medical Laboratory Scientist, you will support clinicians in the diagnosis, management, treatment of disease and develop improved tests for disease detection. You may also recommend possible treatments, monitor dosage and effects, as well as track the progress of patience. There are also career opportunities that involve conducting research into the causes and cures for disease.
You should be inquisitive and have an analytical mind, and you will need to have the ability to absorb, connect and integrate information from various sources. Medical Laboratory Scientists use a range of intricate and sophisticated equipment, so a certain amount of manual dexterity is needed to conduct laboratory work effectively.
Medical Laboratory Scientists are employed in a range of areas, including:

diagnostic pathology
histopathology
forensic science
immunology
virology
transfusion science
haematology
cytology
clinical biochemistry
