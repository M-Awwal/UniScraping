The billions of dollars’ worth of public and private resources invested in rail track infrastructure around the world demand a well-trained and competent engineering workforce for the safe and efficient operation of the track and associated assets. However, developments over the past twenty years, such as downsizing of public railway authorities, increased retirement of experienced employees, privatization, and the rapid expansion of the rail industry have left engineers with severely limited pathways to upskill themselves quickly.
This degree has been developed by railway experts to address the specific needs of the industry. The industry focus of the degree is enhanced through the expectation that students will be employed in the railway industry during all or part of their studies. The units in this master’s degree were structured with this very purpose in mind.
This optimal mix of academic and industry-based learning provides engineers with more advanced skills and knowledge much faster than workplace training can do.
Through EIT’s online delivery, railway engineers can study the degree from anywhere in the world. The blend of differing railway contexts, operating standards, practices, and policies experienced by these engineers living in many countries will provide a unique learning opportunity for them as they interact with each other throughout the degree.
Despite the very diverse locations of railway infrastructure engineers, the course coordinators and lecturers work hard to build a sense of professional community among the students.
The program is delivered using a wide range of learning activities such as live webinars, written assignments, case studies, team projects, remote laboratories, and more. These experiences aim to get the students interacting via technology-based learning experiences that highlight shared skills and knowledge derived from the many cultural and technical contexts in which the students are working.",Potential job roles include engineering and management positions in the following areas of expertise:,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

A powerful force is driving industrial growth and change, and it’s only getting stronger. That force? Uncertainty. Society increasingly demands more efficient transport, more power production, safer energy exploration and processing, less waste, smarter products, and of course, all at lower costs. All these demands display uncertainty and how we need to manage it through engineering, science, and technology.
In the 21st century, industry will routinely deal with novel hazardous processing technologies, complex energy grid load-balancing from renewables, driverless cars, artificial vision to augment control, and feedback in sub-sea exploration   and the infinitesimal scale of nanotechnologies in bionic engineering. Currently, people are at the heart of many hazardous work environments, exposed to the consequences of uncontrolled events. Still, soon, artificial intelligence will afford more human tasks to be automated (and present a host of newer risks in exchange for the retired ones). This progress has to be examined in systematic terms   terms that integrate our understandings of technical fallibility, human error, and political decision-making.
This program has been carefully designed to accomplish three key goals. First, a set of fundamental concepts is described in useful, manageable ways that encourage rapid and integrated knowledge-acquisition.
Second, that knowledge is applied in creative and imaginative ways to afford practical, career-oriented advantages. Third, the learning that results from the integration of knowledge and application is encouraged by activities and projects, culminating in a project thesis that is the capstone of the program.

Electrical safety is a critical issue for those working on electrical facilities in utility networks and large industrial installations. Several serious accidents, including fatalities, occur every. Arc flashes in electrical equipment are now considered one of the major causes of electrical accidents — even surpassing the well-known hazards of electric shock.
Avoiding arc flash incidents and the resulting injuries is one of the biggest challenges facing electrical workers. It requires adequate attention in the stages of system planning, design, installation, operation, and maintenance. Today, a considerable body of knowledge exists as a result of research efforts, and is available to designers and maintenance engineers in the form of standards such as IEEE 1584 and NFPA 70E.
This course will detail the basis of this approach, and also the significant advances that have been made in the area of Personal Protective Equipment made of Fire Resistant fabrics and rated for different levels of thermal exposure.
Prevention, however, remains the best form of protection, and switchgear manufacturers have made considerable design advances to ensure that the effect of arc flash incidents is contained within the enclosure of switchgear (often called arc flash resistant switchgear). Methods of testing such switchgear have also evolved simultaneously.
Another critical factor is the approach to avoid arc incidents within the switchgear by proper design and maintenance and techniques to reduce the severity of the flash should such incidents occur. These will form the key focus areas of this course.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Python is an object-oriented generic programming language that is particularly suited to the modern world. It is an excellent choice for introducing fundamental programming concepts as it reduces the complexity of problem-solving by hiding the intricate arcane detail ‘under the hood.’ Python can do in a single line what many programming languages require multiple lines of code to achieve.
Automation of tasks is a critical part of every engineer’s jobs today. Design probably only takes 10 percent of an engineer’s time — most of the day-to-day work is in research, testing of prototypes, debugging, production testing, and documentation. Python is now increasingly used in the automation and embedded systems world. Specific tasks for Python include testing, data collection, and automation.
Therefore, there is a growing need for Python programming skills by industry (typically manufacturing, mining, healthcare, and energy). This program focuses on giving you a solid foundation in the use of this language. This allows you to leave the program with a strong capability in programming with Python, rather than superficially skimming through the language. Naturally, you will need to apply your knowledge to engineering tasks to extend and solidify your proficiency.
This program focuses on specific engineering disciplines: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial automation, and civil engineering.
Electrical Engineering applications include file processing (conversion from one format to another such as XML to CSV), automation of test equipment and data (such as waveforms for power quality problems), and database management (such as SQL).
Mechanical Engineering is often considered to be disconnected from the need for programming knowledge. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Areas such as numerical analysis (with awkward boundary conditions) in manufacturing, automotive, energy spheres of activity, and thermodynamics (ranging from fluid dynamics to chemical kinetics) require programming knowledge. It is also imperative in computational fluid dynamics.
Civil Engineering applications include risk assessment and mitigation for floods, cyclones, earthquakes, prediction of traffic trends, stress analysis of data from bridges, analysis of vast amounts of geotechnical data.
Industrial Automation application includes analysis of vast amounts of data from processes, logging data over a Modbus communication link, and preventative maintenance. It also includes translating a PLC database and converting this into a bunch of HTML files.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Construction is the largest industry in the world. Within a civil engineering context, construction may refer to bridges, dams, earthworks, foundations, offshore structures, pipelines, power stations, railways, retaining structures, roads, tunnels, waterways, and water or wastewater infrastructures.
Anything constructed needs to be designed first. Structural engineering deals with the analysis and design aspects required to ensure a safe, functional, and economical end product. During the design process, the designer may regularly interact with specialists such as architects and operational managers. Once the design is finalized, the implementation requires people to handle aspects such as statutory approvals, planning, quality assurance, and material procurement.
The entire exercise can be undertaken in a highly-coordinated way if everyone involves understands the terminology or ‘project language.’ To fully understand this language, it is necessary to appreciate the principles of structural analysis and design.
Participants in this course will gain a basic knowledge of structural engineering that includes the principles of analysis of structures and their application, the behavior of materials under loading, the selection of construction materials, and the design fundamentals for Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) and steel structures.

Substations are critical assets in any power system and serve as important nodes in a transmission and distribution network. Substations, therefore, handle multiple voltages in a given location and link two or more systems of different voltages.
This course will focus on subsystems that perform essential functions in substations. These include earthing and grounding, lightning protection of outdoor equipment and substation buildings, power system protection, control, and interlocking equipment, including the auxiliary power sources and various switchyard facilities. These include foundation, structures, cable routing, lighting, fire protection and surveillance equipment.
Earthing of a high voltage switchyard requires careful design as it has a direct bearing on safety. The design approach to switchyards will be discussed, and the basic methods of calculation will be outlined. Lightning is a common threat to substation equipment and supply reliability, as overvoltage surges can result in insulation failure or spark over. While lightning cannot be prevented, its effects can be minimized by proper lightning and surge protection measures.
Any electrical equipment is susceptible to insulation failures. Protection against such failures and the resulting short circuits is a vital need in power systems. The various protection options available to the designer and the protection of busbars, transformers, and substation feeders will be discussed.
Another essential system is the control of switchyard equipment and the required auxiliary power supply. AC auxiliary power is used for the operation of isolators and disconnectors, the operating mechanism of circuit breakers, and substation lighting. The essential functions are powered through DC supply backed with batteries for reliability. This includes control, annunciation and protection functions, breaker close and trip commands, and in some cases, emergency lighting.
A switchyard has to be adequately planned by preparing the site, measuring earth resistivity required for earthing design and optimization, earthwork, foundations, cable trenches inside the switchyard, draining arrangements, etc. These aspects will be covered in detail during the course. We will also discuss gas-insulated switchgear as an alternative to outdoor open type switchyards.

Depending on the functions performed by a substation, the configuration and complexity can be quite varied. The skill of the designer is to anticipate the present and future needs that the substation will cater to, select appropriate design configuration, and calculate the ratings of main equipment such as busbars, transformers, and switchgear to ensure trouble-free service over several decades.
Sufficient thought should be given to the need for maintaining critical substation equipment, and appropriate redundancies must be planned as well. This is essential as otherwise the consumers fed by the substation can suffer frequent supply outages, which is undesirable from both a service and a financial point of view.
It is also necessary to ensure that the substation will work satisfactorily under various normal and not-so-normal situations (such as short circuits and other types of abnormal events that can occur in a system) without any failures. This is done through various calculations that are performed to reflect a set of simulated conditions. These calculations are collectively called as system studies. The type of studies will depend upon the complexity and criticality of the substation and the loads connected to it. The simulations are carried out using specialized computer software.
A designer should have a clear understanding of the studies that need to be performed in a given case and should also be able to decide the conditions that need to be simulated for each study. System studies can often bring out problem areas in the design. These need to be addressed by appropriate solutions involving equipment for voltage improvement, fault limiters, and flicker compensation.
Modern industries give rise to sizeable harmonic components, which can result in premature equipment failures by heating and or harmonic resonance. Harmonic filters and other measures to inhibit resonance will have to be planned in such cases.
These studies, when performed at the design stage, permit the designer to include the required corrective equipment proactively and integrate them with the rest of the system by providing proper space and switchgear as a part of the substation design, rather than as an afterthought.
This practical course will cover these complex issues through a simple step-by-step approach and real-life examples.
