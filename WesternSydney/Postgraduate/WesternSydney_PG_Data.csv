These may include: structuralism, poststructuralism, feminism, postcolonialism, psychoanalysis and posthumanism. In presenting this âcontemporaryâ mode of engaging with literary texts, âLiterary Theoryâ asks how we might theorise our approach to reading, and how individual texts allow us to theorise the literary in general.",Writing and Form,,"Literature has always involved playing with language and shaping words into specific forms.

Focusing on literature and how meaning is created in literary form the unit will consider the interaction between the created world and the real world. It will focus on method and process in writing. In doing this it will engage with ideas from a number of areas, including science, philosophy, and literary theory in considering particular aspects of both our interaction with world, and how it shapes us, and the manner in which art shapes and forces itself upon the world. A specific theme related to the process of creation in art will be addressed.",Gender and Genre,,"This unit considers the intersection of gender and genre in various narrative forms. Through a variety of texts that may include polemic, conduct literature, plays, novels, poetry and film, students will examine the construction of masculinity and femininity within various genres, and consider the ways in which genres themselves may be gendered. Beginning in the seventeenth century, the unit also considers the strategies that women writers, in particular, have used to participate in literary production by adopting and adapting particular generic conventions. A consideration of the ways in which gender and genre may be connected also allows students to consider questions of literary production and circulation, literary value and reputation.","Writing, Sounds, Images, Texts",,"This unit will involve a reflection on practice-based research in the arts.

How does technology influence our understanding of nature? What are the ethical implications arising from human relations with the natural world? As well learning time-honoured answers to such questions, students will appreciate the practical relevance of philosophical theorising about nature.",Political Philosophy,,"According to Aristotle's famous definition, the human is a political animal. Since the first theorization of the political in ancient Greek philosophy, politics has been thought from a variety of different angles. These range from traditional approaches such as the forms of government or the ways in which the sovereign can exercise power, to contemporary alternative approaches, such as theories of radical democracy which emphasize the participatory and agonistic aspects of the political. This unit will cover some fundamental texts and ideas in political philosophy.",Topics in the History of Philosophy,,"This unit surveys selected philosophers or philosophical movements in the history of philosophy, and of the relevance of such philosophical perspectives for contemporary debates. The unit will include a selection of material that will give students a deeper understanding of the history of philosophy from Ancient Greece to the present day.",Philosophy and Literature,,"The relationship between philosophy and literature is as old as philosophy itself.  In fact, philosophy begins and defines itself in Ancient Greece by setting itself apart from literature â specifically, epic and tragic writings â and claiming for itself a more original role in the effort to understand what is true, what matters, and how one should be with others.  From Ancient Greece, through Hellenism and the Roman world, and into the Medieval and Modern periods there was an enduring concern in philosophical traditions with literature, literary themes, and questions of style.  However, at the end of the Modern period the concern with literature became so pronounced that philosophers began to write literary texts and to experiment with new styles of expression.  Beginning with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and moving up to Sartre and Camus, this question of the relation of philosophy and literature has become a central concern of many contemporary philosophical traditions.  This unit will be devoted to exploring both the history of this relation between philosophy and literature, as well as looking more carefully at various moments in that history.",Practical Philosophy,,"The unit Practical Philosophy deals with the application of philosophical understanding to human activity. âPractical philosophyâ in principle encompasses questions of the meaning and appropriateness of various practices, as well as theoretical questions about the nature of practices themselves, questions such as âWhat should we do?â and âWhat is it that we are doing?â The unit may thus involve considering philosophical perspectives on ethical, political, educational, and legal questions, and more abstract considerations relating to practices such as the philosophy of action.",Research Project in Philosophy,,"Research Project in Philosophy develops research techniques, understanding of methodologies, and procedures in planning and drafting a philosophical project. Through identifying contemporary issues and questions suitable for graduate-level research. Students will each develop an individual written project that articulates a coherent philosophical perspective. The aim of the unit is to develop students' understanding of philosophical vocabularies, specific discourses, and logics as they pertain to a particular philosophical issue or problem that they will address in writing.",Ethics,,"Since the beginning of philosophy, the question of how to live has taken on an indefinite variety of forms, as befits the variability of its subject matter. This includes the Platonic and Aristotelian conception of the good life, the Kantian categorical imperative, and social ethics. In recent Continental philosophy, this has encompassed the ethics of responsibility, the attempt to investigate the ethics of alterity, interest in the 'care-of-the-self', and the ethics of truth.",Philosophical Aesthetics,,"This unit involves study of aesthetics, which may include philosophical approaches to art and artistic genres such as literature and cinema, and to beauty itself. It will include an historical overview of the field, an analysis of one particular set of problems or debates, and a close examination of a specific school or thinker. It will explore concepts of aesthetic judgement and value, as well as the relationship between aesthetics and other aspects of philosophy.",Special Topics in Philosophy,,The Special Topics in Philosophy unit engages with current debates and developments in philosophy. These contemporary debates will be contextualized within the historical and conceptual framework of the continental tradition of philosophical inquiry. Engagement with contemporary topics in philosophy and the most recent developments in the field will enable students to find what is innovative and original in their own thought and field of research.,Theoretical Philosophy,,"Theoretical Philosophy focuses on theories of knowledge, theories of being, and systems of thought. While it is traditionally described under the heading of epistemology and metaphysics, theoretical philosophy should be more broadly understood as devoted to philosophical investigations into the underlying systems, theories, and presuppositions upon which any account of the world, experience, or even truth has been built. This unit will be devoted to an explication of either thematically related theoretical investigations, such as, for example, â17th-century theories of matter,â or âthe nature of language,â or it will focus instead on one central philosophical figure, e.g., âPlatoâs metaphysics of the soul,â âKantâs system of transcendental idealism,â etc.","Philosophy, History and Interpretation",,"The focus of this unit will be a topic, or range of topics, particularly relevant in philosophy, which will be analysed both in their historical context and through subsequent interpretations by other philosophers or philosophical traditions. The unit will combine the hermeneutic interpretation of texts together with conceptual and argumentative analysis. Close attention will be paid to the language and systematic content of the philosophical issues examined. Moreover, students will be guided in factoring in the historical situation both for the philosopher(s) examined and for us as interpreters.",Advanced Research Project in Philosophy,,"Advance Research Project in Philosophy enables students with significant knowledge in philosophy and some experience in research techniques and methodologies in philosophy to plan and draft a philosophical project.

Opportunities for investigation and discussion of current research particularly related to sustainability and diversity in the teaching of the specific subject area will be important.",Disability in Context,," The developmental trajectory and quality of life of individuals with additional needs is affected not only by the nature and level of the disability itself but also by the ways in which that disability interacts with the contexts in which they live their lives. In turn, the impact of the disability will affect the individualâs family and those working with them. This unit adopts both a developmental and ecological perspective to enable analysis of the specific impact of disability on an individual, their family, the professionals working with them and the contexts in which they do so. In so doing, it evaluates the efficacy of theoretical models and frameworks available to assist in ensuring best outcomes for the individual and those around them.","Education Policy, Practice and Global Knowledge Co-construction",,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. This Unit explores the relationship between education and knowledge through reference to questions about the links between education policy practices and global knowledge production. The conceptual framework which provides the focus for this Unit explores the dynamic, cyclical relations between the following: conditions of possibility for linking education policy practices and global knowledge production; contexts of negotiation/distance that affect this relationship; the modes of reception and rejection of the impact of linking of the two, and the mechanisms of connection that make this possible.  These core concepts provide a focus for exploring questions about the relationship between âeducation policy practicesâ and âglobal knowledge productionâ in studentsâ everyday work-life.",Principles and Practices of Evaluation,,"This unit provides opportunities to examine and apply evaluation strategies to assess and evaluate learning, educational and social programs and policies. Theories drawn from evaluation will be used to assist students to develop evaluative frameworks and approaches to critically evaluating programs.",Effective Working Relationships,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. This unit supports the development of studentsâ knowledge and skills by analysing a range of consultation models; examining the perspectives and needs of families as well as professionals from different discipline backgrounds; and developing effective interpersonal communication skills, collaborative problem solving, dispute resolution, teamwork and teambuilding.  In addition, professionals with advanced knowledge of inclusive education and disability studies may serve as agents of change within their professional setting.

Students will have opportunities for investigation and discussion of current research particularly related to sustainability and diversity in the teaching of the specific subject area.",Social Ecology,,"This unit focuses on learning in the context of social-ecological understanding. It asserts that ecological sustainability is a consequence of the understanding and enactment of social-ecological relationships. In this regard âsocial ecologyâ describes a field of understanding while âsustainabilityâ describes praxis in a social-ecological context. Both experience and the understanding of experience â learning- are subject matter. This study is undertaken through reference to ecological systems of understandings in the context of challenges to that understanding. It is grounded in reference to learning, change, creativity, culture, politics and the physical environment. The unit introduces key theorists and invites students to examine their personal relationship to social-ecological learning.",Engaging Communities,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. Community engagement is variously seen as a strategy for improving educational outcomes, increasing community ownership and/or empowering citizens to take collective action. Although appeals to âcommunityâ often assume a homogeneous ideal, active community engagement needs to respond to a diversity of needs and experiences. This unit begins by exploring the notion of community, its uses and meanings in different discursive and professional contexts. Students will be introduced to theory and praxis aimed at identifying community needs, partnering across diversity and working effectively and inclusively to build community strengths and engagement. The unitâs applied learning focus requires students to develop and implement a community engagement strategy for a selected setting.",Transformative Learning,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. This unit provides opportunities to examine and apply theories drawn from critical pedagogy, transformative learning and ecological thinking. It challenges students to critically examine the relationships through which personal and social knowledge is constructed and their efficacy in the construction of learning for the future. Inherent in such thinking are questions about the processes of change in education systems that will lead towards equity, inclusiveness, wellbeing, social justice and ecological sustainability.",Universal Design for Learning,,"Developing the ability to meet the needs of a diverse group of learners within a flexible learning situation is critical to promote inclusion.  This unit reviews multiple approaches and strategies employed (e.g. accommodation, adjustment, differentiation) and advocates for Universal Design for Learning to achieve this goal. Strategies are critiqued based on their capacity to enhance learning outcomes for individuals with additional needs and to advance inclusion. These analyses are then used to develop strategies and methods which can facilitate the learning and inclusion of individuals with a range of abilities, skills and needs. Students evaluate strategies, plan and reflect on a learning experience based on Universal Design for Learning.",Secondary Curriculum 1C,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. All students seeking an additional secondary teaching area qualification must complete this Years 7-10 teaching methodology unit.

Students will have opportunities for investigation and discussion of current research particularly related to sustainability and diversity in the teaching of the specific subject area.",At the cultural interface - learning two ways,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. History, politics and ignorance make the cultural interface between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians contested and fraught. In turn, cultural misunderstanding contributes to inequities in educational attainment, employment and social disadvantage. Students apply a critical perspective to the discourses surrounding Aboriginal disadvantage and white privilege. They develop processes to engage respectfully with local Aboriginal and Islander communities in order to learn and share in a two-way exchange of knowledge. They listen deeply and intersubjectively in their exploration of Aboriginal worldviews, and they reflect on what it means to decolonise their own thinking so as to build partnerships based on mutuality and reciprocity.",Person-Centred Practice,,"The shift in educational policy and legislation to one of inclusion has been accompanied by a move to models of service delivery which are person- and family-centred and which also recognise the need for tiers in intervention. Whilst the range of service delivery models currently operating across educational and community settings for varied levels of need and developmental stages will be explored and evaluated, emphasis will be given to person-centred practice. Through an analysis of the literature encompassing both evidence-based practice and practice-based evidence students will evaluate the implications of the model for individuals, families, teachers, other professionals, schools, services, their own practice and for systems practice.",Inclusive Environments,,"Significant reform has occurred over the last three decades with regard to educating individuals with additional needs. This unit explores the history and current position on disability as well as philosophy, policy, legislation, and practice around educating individuals with additional needs internationally.  The research literature examining the benefits and barriers to inclusive education will be analysed.  Students will develop skills of critical review required to evaluate the research in the field. Lastly, the unit addresses the ways in which educational settings can be designed to be more responsive to learners with additional needs and how students can promote inclusion through organisational change.",Ecopsychology and Cultural Change,,"From 2020 students should note that core units are now taught in semesters rather than half yearly sessions. Ecopsychology is concerned with the relationship between human consciousness, human actions and environmental issues. It seeks to understand the sources, both phenomenological and socio-cultural, of the disjuncture between nature and psyche and to develop possibilities for personal and cultural re-connection and healing. Through applying experiential methods, critical inquiry and engagement with ecopsychological writings, students develop their awareness of ""self"", ""nature"", ""culture"" and explore the dynamics between them. The unit incorporates perspectives on ecological identity, ecospirituality and sense of place as ways of re-imagining the human-nature relationship and effecting ecologically-oriented change."

Focusing on literature and how meaning is created in literary form the unit will consider the interaction between the created world and the real world. It will focus on method and process in writing. In doing this it will engage with ideas from a number of areas, including science, philosophy, and literary theory in considering particular aspects of both our interaction with world, and how it shapes us, and the manner in which art shapes and forces itself upon the world. A specific theme related to the process of creation in art will be addressed.",Literary Theory,,"This unit examines a range of theoretical approaches to literature, the majority of which have proliferated since the beginning of the 20th century. These may include: structuralism, poststructuralism, feminism, postcolonialism, psychoanalysis and posthumanism. In presenting this âcontemporaryâ mode of engaging with literary texts, âLiterary Theoryâ asks how we might theorise our approach to reading, and how individual texts allow us to theorise the literary in general.",Applied Methods in Literary Studies and Creative Writing,,"This unit familiarises students with methods of pursuing and presenting research across the discipline of literary studies as well as with regard to the kinds of research required for undertaking creative writing.

The unit is comprised of specific training exercises, which will enable students to develop the research skills necessary to developing for their masters project.",Writing and Ideas,,"This unit will focus on a particular idea or concept that is of major importance to the diverse cultural, artistic and philosophical understandings we have of ourselves. It will then look to explore how the idea operates through these differing understandings and the problems it poses for representation. The theoretical and creative texts examined will focus both on the nature of the idea and how it might be better understood or made use of in creative practice.",Masters Project,,"The Masters Project is the culmination of the Master of Arts in Literature and Creative Writing. Students will build up to being able to complete a long written project. For many students this will be a creative project (creative writing, or related media including music). This involves both the creative work (normally 11,000 words) along with an 'exegesis' that offers a critical overview of the ideas within it (4,000 words).

Throughout we will make comparisons with the relationship between sound and text in film, and in the media more broadly.",Gender and Genre,,"This unit considers the intersection of gender and genre in various narrative forms. Through a variety of texts that may include polemic, conduct literature, plays, novels, poetry and film, students will examine the construction of masculinity and femininity within various genres, and consider the ways in which genres themselves may be gendered. Beginning in the seventeenth century, the unit also considers the strategies that women writers, in particular, have used to participate in literary production by adopting and adapting particular generic conventions. A consideration of the ways in which gender and genre may be connected also allows students to consider questions of literary production and circulation, literary value and reputation.",Writing Practice and Tradition,,This unit will consider the nature of writing in terms of both writing and editorial practice. It will involve the analysis of major works by writers (both of fiction and non-fiction) within particular traditions and communities and reflect on the themes of these works and the processes through which they emerge.

It will explore concepts of aesthetic judgement and value, as well as the relationship between aesthetics and other aspects of philosophy.",Political Philosophy,,"According to Aristotle's famous definition, the human is a political animal. Since the first theorization of the political in ancient Greek philosophy, politics has been thought from a variety of different angles. These range from traditional approaches such as the forms of government or the ways in which the sovereign can exercise power, to contemporary alternative approaches, such as theories of radical democracy which emphasize the participatory and agonistic aspects of the political. This unit will cover some fundamental texts and ideas in political philosophy.",Topics in the History of Philosophy,,"This unit surveys selected philosophers or philosophical movements in the history of philosophy, and of the relevance of such philosophical perspectives for contemporary debates. The unit will include a selection of material that will give students a deeper understanding of the history of philosophy from Ancient Greece to the present day.",Practical Philosophy,,"The unit Practical Philosophy deals with the application of philosophical understanding to human activity. âPractical philosophyâ in principle encompasses questions of the meaning and appropriateness of various practices, as well as theoretical questions about the nature of practices themselves, questions such as âWhat should we do?â and âWhat is it that we are doing?â The unit may thus involve considering philosophical perspectives on ethical, political, educational, and legal questions, and more abstract considerations relating to practices such as the philosophy of action.",Theoretical Philosophy,,"Theoretical Philosophy focuses on theories of knowledge, theories of being, and systems of thought. While it is traditionally described under the heading of epistemology and metaphysics, theoretical philosophy should be more broadly understood as devoted to philosophical investigations into the underlying systems, theories, and presuppositions upon which any account of the world, experience, or even truth has been built. This unit will be devoted to an explication of either thematically related theoretical investigations, such as, for example, â17th-century theories of matter,â or âthe nature of language,â or it will focus instead on one central philosophical figure, e.g., âPlatoâs metaphysics of the soul,â âKantâs system of transcendental idealism,â etc.",Philosophy and Literature,,"The relationship between philosophy and literature is as old as philosophy itself.  In fact, philosophy begins and defines itself in Ancient Greece by setting itself apart from literature â specifically, epic and tragic writings â and claiming for itself a more original role in the effort to understand what is true, what matters, and how one should be with others.  From Ancient Greece, through Hellenism and the Roman world, and into the Medieval and Modern periods there was an enduring concern in philosophical traditions with literature, literary themes, and questions of style.  However, at the end of the Modern period the concern with literature became so pronounced that philosophers began to write literary texts and to experiment with new styles of expression.  Beginning with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and moving up to Sartre and Camus, this question of the relation of philosophy and literature has become a central concern of many contemporary philosophical traditions.  This unit will be devoted to exploring both the history of this relation between philosophy and literature, as well as looking more carefully at various moments in that history.",Ethics,,"Since the beginning of philosophy, the question of how to live has taken on an indefinite variety of forms, as befits the variability of its subject matter. This includes the Platonic and Aristotelian conception of the good life, the Kantian categorical imperative, and social ethics. In recent Continental philosophy, this has encompassed the ethics of responsibility, the attempt to investigate the ethics of alterity, interest in the 'care-of-the-self', and the ethics of truth.",Advanced Research Project in Philosophy,,"Advance Research Project in Philosophy enables students with significant knowledge in philosophy and some experience in research techniques and methodologies in philosophy to plan and draft a philosophical project.

The unit will combine the hermeneutic interpretation of texts together with conceptual and argumentative analysis. Close attention will be paid to the language and systematic content of the philosophical issues examined. Moreover, students will be guided in factoring in the historical situation both for the philosopher(s) examined and for us as interpreters.",Special Topics in Philosophy,,The Special Topics in Philosophy unit engages with current debates and developments in philosophy.

Academia",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,Theoretical Philosophy,,"Theoretical Philosophy focuses on theories of knowledge, theories of being, and systems of thought. While it is traditionally described under the heading of epistemology and metaphysics, theoretical philosophy should be more broadly understood as devoted to philosophical investigations into the underlying systems, theories, and presuppositions upon which any account of the world, experience, or even truth has been built. This unit will be devoted to an explication of either thematically related theoretical investigations, such as, for example, â17th-century theories of matter,â or âthe nature of language,â or it will focus instead on one central philosophical figure, e.g., âPlatoâs metaphysics of the soul,â âKantâs system of transcendental idealism,â etc.",Topics in the History of Philosophy,,"This unit surveys selected philosophers or philosophical movements in the history of philosophy, and of the relevance of such philosophical perspectives for contemporary debates. The unit will include a selection of material that will give students a deeper understanding of the history of philosophy from Ancient Greece to the present day.",Political Philosophy,,"According to Aristotle's famous definition, the human is a political animal. Since the first theorization of the political in ancient Greek philosophy, politics has been thought from a variety of different angles. These range from traditional approaches such as the forms of government or the ways in which the sovereign can exercise power, to contemporary alternative approaches, such as theories of radical democracy which emphasize the participatory and agonistic aspects of the political. This unit will cover some fundamental texts and ideas in political philosophy.",Philosophical Aesthetics,,"This unit involves study of aesthetics, which may include philosophical approaches to art and artistic genres such as literature and cinema, and to beauty itself. It will include an historical overview of the field, an analysis of one particular set of problems or debates, and a close examination of a specific school or thinker. It will explore concepts of aesthetic judgement and value, as well as the relationship between aesthetics and other aspects of philosophy.",Philosophy of Nature,,"This unit examines questions and problems concerning the concept of nature or ânaturalnessâ.  What does it mean to call something ânaturalâ and how are natural things to be distinguished from artificial things or things that are human made? How does technology influence our understanding of nature? What are the ethical implications arising from human relations with the natural world? As well learning time-honoured answers to such questions, students will appreciate the practical relevance of philosophical theorising about nature.",Research Project in Philosophy,,"Research Project in Philosophy develops research techniques, understanding of methodologies, and procedures in planning and drafting a philosophical project. Through identifying contemporary issues and questions suitable for graduate-level research. Students will each develop an individual written project that articulates a coherent philosophical perspective. The aim of the unit is to develop students' understanding of philosophical vocabularies, specific discourses, and logics as they pertain to a particular philosophical issue or problem that they will address in writing.",Practical Philosophy,,"The unit Practical Philosophy deals with the application of philosophical understanding to human activity. âPractical philosophyâ in principle encompasses questions of the meaning and appropriateness of various practices, as well as theoretical questions about the nature of practices themselves, questions such as âWhat should we do?â and âWhat is it that we are doing?â The unit may thus involve considering philosophical perspectives on ethical, political, educational, and legal questions, and more abstract considerations relating to practices such as the philosophy of action.",Ethics,,"Since the beginning of philosophy, the question of how to live has taken on an indefinite variety of forms, as befits the variability of its subject matter. This includes the Platonic and Aristotelian conception of the good life, the Kantian categorical imperative, and social ethics. In recent Continental philosophy, this has encompassed the ethics of responsibility, the attempt to investigate the ethics of alterity, interest in the 'care-of-the-self', and the ethics of truth.","Philosophy, History and Interpretation",,"The focus of this unit will be a topic, or range of topics, particularly relevant in philosophy, which will be analysed both in their historical context and through subsequent interpretations by other philosophers or philosophical traditions. The unit will combine the hermeneutic interpretation of texts together with conceptual and argumentative analysis. Close attention will be paid to the language and systematic content of the philosophical issues examined. Moreover, students will be guided in factoring in the historical situation both for the philosopher(s) examined and for us as interpreters.",Special Topics in Philosophy,,The Special Topics in Philosophy unit engages with current debates and developments in philosophy. These contemporary debates will be contextualized within the historical and conceptual framework of the continental tradition of philosophical inquiry. Engagement with contemporary topics in philosophy and the most recent developments in the field will enable students to find what is innovative and original in their own thought and field of research.,Philosophy and Literature,,"The relationship between philosophy and literature is as old as philosophy itself.  In fact, philosophy begins and defines itself in Ancient Greece by setting itself apart from literature â specifically, epic and tragic writings â and claiming for itself a more original role in the effort to understand what is true, what matters, and how one should be with others.  From Ancient Greece, through Hellenism and the Roman world, and into the Medieval and Modern periods there was an enduring concern in philosophical traditions with literature, literary themes, and questions of style.  However, at the end of the Modern period the concern with literature became so pronounced that philosophers began to write literary texts and to experiment with new styles of expression.  Beginning with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and moving up to Sartre and Camus, this question of the relation of philosophy and literature has become a central concern of many contemporary philosophical traditions.  This unit will be devoted to exploring both the history of this relation between philosophy and literature, as well as looking more carefully at various moments in that history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Academia",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,Ethics,,"Since the beginning of philosophy, the question of how to live has taken on an indefinite variety of forms, as befits the variability of its subject matter. This includes the Platonic and Aristotelian conception of the good life, the Kantian categorical imperative, and social ethics. In recent Continental philosophy, this has encompassed the ethics of responsibility, the attempt to investigate the ethics of alterity, interest in the 'care-of-the-self', and the ethics of truth.",Philosophy of Nature,,"This unit examines questions and problems concerning the concept of nature or ânaturalnessâ.  What does it mean to call something ânaturalâ and how are natural things to be distinguished from artificial things or things that are human made?

As well learning time-honoured answers to such questions, students will appreciate the practical relevance of philosophical theorising about nature.",Topics in the History of Philosophy,,"This unit surveys selected philosophers or philosophical movements in the history of philosophy, and of the relevance of such philosophical perspectives for contemporary debates. The unit will include a selection of material that will give students a deeper understanding of the history of philosophy from Ancient Greece to the present day.",Political Philosophy,,"According to Aristotle's famous definition, the human is a political animal. Since the first theorization of the political in ancient Greek philosophy, politics has been thought from a variety of different angles. These range from traditional approaches such as the forms of government or the ways in which the sovereign can exercise power, to contemporary alternative approaches, such as theories of radical democracy which emphasize the participatory and agonistic aspects of the political. This unit will cover some fundamental texts and ideas in political philosophy.","Philosophy, History and Interpretation",,"The focus of this unit will be a topic, or range of topics, particularly relevant in philosophy, which will be analysed both in their historical context and through subsequent interpretations by other philosophers or philosophical traditions.

Engagement with contemporary topics in philosophy and the most recent developments in the field will enable students to find what is innovative and original in their own thought and field of research.,Philosophy and Literature,,"The relationship between philosophy and literature is as old as philosophy itself.  In fact, philosophy begins and defines itself in Ancient Greece by setting itself apart from literature â specifically, epic and tragic writings â and claiming for itself a more original role in the effort to understand what is true, what matters, and how one should be with others.  From Ancient Greece, through Hellenism and the Roman world, and into the Medieval and Modern periods there was an enduring concern in philosophical traditions with literature, literary themes, and questions of style.  However, at the end of the Modern period the concern with literature became so pronounced that philosophers began to write literary texts and to experiment with new styles of expression.  Beginning with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and moving up to Sartre and Camus, this question of the relation of philosophy and literature has become a central concern of many contemporary philosophical traditions.  This unit will be devoted to exploring both the history of this relation between philosophy and literature, as well as looking more carefully at various moments in that history.",Theoretical Philosophy,,"Theoretical Philosophy focuses on theories of knowledge, theories of being, and systems of thought. While it is traditionally described under the heading of epistemology and metaphysics, theoretical philosophy should be more broadly understood as devoted to philosophical investigations into the underlying systems, theories, and presuppositions upon which any account of the world, experience, or even truth has been built. This unit will be devoted to an explication of either thematically related theoretical investigations, such as, for example, â17th-century theories of matter,â or âthe nature of language,â or it will focus instead on one central philosophical figure, e.g., âPlatoâs metaphysics of the soul,â âKantâs system of transcendental idealism,â etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-government organisations",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,,Transnational Crime,,"In traditional criminology crimes have been understood as acts that breach the criminal code of a given nation state. By contrast, transnational crimes are defined as violations of law that embrace more than one nation in their planning, operation or impact. These crimes often have a much broader (though often veiled) relation to serious individual and collective social harm and can be especially difficult to prevent or investigate and prosecute. Students will be expected to understand the global and regional developments that foster transnational crime, its range and security impacts, and international agreements and conventions as well the new forms of policing developed to counter it.",Political Economy of Development,,"The unit introduces students to the main theories and the diverse political economy dimensions of development. It consists of three modules. The first deals with key concepts that interrogate the meaning of development, origins of prosperity and the concepts of poverty, inequality and redistribution, which are contentious in their applications to various groups. The second module examines core issues in the political economy of development, which include globalisation, foreign aid, democracy, conflict and the role of the state.  The last module engages with pertinent case studies focusing on Asia, the Pacific as well as problems with development in the Western world.","Violence, Culture and Criminal Justice",,"In recent decades, a new wave of racial, ethnic and religious violence and terrorism has been linked to rapid patterns of globalisation and tensions over group and national identities. Specific knowledge about violence and considerations about its real extent, causes and cultural meanings remain uncertain. Yet there is evidence of a recent general decline in violence with a significant role for legal and quasi-legal bodies for acknowledging injury, punishing previously âdeniableâ violence and promoting reconciliation. Seminar topics in this course will include the global patterns and forms of violence; individual versus societal and historical explanations; biology, evolution and culture; gender, race and inequality; hatred, genocide, collective identity and psychoanalysis; the role of states and law in countering and condoning interpersonal and collective violence; debates about victimhood and the cultural symbols of violence and its memorialisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the epidemiological and statistical evidence for the findings are critically assessed.",Methods of Researching,,"From 2015 students should take 401080 - Research Protocol Design and Practice. In this unit postgraduate students develop a proposal for a research study in an area of interest, drawing upon their knowledge and experiences from other units in their program of study. Students learn how to apply research methods to a variety of research situations and questions; to understand how research questions are developed and answered empirically through suitable choice of research methodology, design and method; and how research findings are validated and communicated. The unit is taught through self-paced, self-directed learning. Class contact is three days of workshops, in the first and second half of the session.","Public Health, Policy and Society",,"This unit examines the nature of public health and develops a systemic understanding of various public health policy frameworks and issues. The unit provides the context and history for understanding public health approaches, explores the cultural and social dimensions of health and illness and the economic and political environment in which health policies and strategies are developed and implemented. The unit advocates a view of health that includes an implicit recognition of the physical, social and economic environment, affirms the importance of social justice and equity in health care, and emphasises the importance of inter-sectoral collaboration.",Health Workforce Planning,,"This is a flexible learning unit looking at Human Resource Management as a strategic activity of health organisations especially as workforce shortages pose significant challenges to the health, welfare and aged care sectors. The workforce, with appropriate knowledge and expertise, is essential to the efficient and effective delivery of quality health services.  Successful organisations shape their workforce to anticipate current and future business directions and goals.  Workforce planning is a crucial element of this approach and its success.",Leadership and the Development of Organisational Capacity,,"This unit examines the concept, form and structure of health care organisations. Organisational theory is explored and used to analyse a range of structures used in nursing and contemporary health care. Factors which influence organisational design, function and effectiveness are explored and discussed including: organisational behaviour, strategy, culture, power and politics, technology, sustainability and effectiveness. A major focus in the unit is planning for strategic organisational development to meet the challenges of rapid change and the need for performance improvements in patient care delivery. Concepts related to the strategic development of workforce capacity in the health care arena are considered through the application of a range of theories including the learning organisation. Leadership will be examined within the context of the unit with a particular emphasis on change management.",Health Economics and Comparative Health Systems,,"The unit explores contemporary examples of the role of economics in the organisation, funding and provision of health services. Case examples include, Australia, America, China, Hong Kong, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and India.  Students use the principles of economics to assess funding of health with a focus on the interface between economics, ethics and equity in decision making. They also consider the tendency for health systems to be organised around economic principles in areas such as, contracting out, health insurance and pharmaceuticals.  Students are encouraged to reflect on the challenges and future directions of their own health system in the context of the unit components.",Surveillance and Disaster Planning,,"As the world responds to climate change and increased globalisation, the human population is becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural and human disasters. This unit equips students with skills in disaster preparedness and public health surveillance. It addresses the psychosocial and mental health aspects of disaster management, the systems of disaster response and how these aspects are relevant across the all-hazard approach to Prevention, Preparation, Response and Recovery (PPRR). Using current evidence and understanding of this field, students will gain knowledge, skills and experience in leadership and management across the PPRR spectrum and the public health, clinical and other coordination in terms of impact and outcome. Australian requirements and systems in relation to surveillance and disaster planning will be analysed as will international and Australian roles in the region.",Evidence-based Nursing,,"In 2015, this unit is replaced by 401168 - Evidence Based Health Care. This unit is designed to develop students' knowledge of the principles and processes necessary for evidence-based clinical practice. General concepts associated with evidence-based nursing are explored. In addition students are assisted to formulate focussed clinical questions and conduct a comprehensive literature search for research evidence that may assist in answering such questions. Issues and techniques involved in the rigorous appraisal of research reports are addressed. The importance of clinical significance and individual patient preferences when making clinical judgments about the implementation of research findings are also explored.",Safety and Risk Management,,"This unit provides a critical insight into the theory and practice of managing safety and health at the workplace with a dual focus on risk management and safety management. Students have the opportunity to develop a safety systems approach concentrating on hazard identification, risk assessment and devising control measures incorporating safety management principles. Safety culture and its influence on Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) practice is also detailed. In addition, the unit addresses the legal underpinning of OHS requirements at the workplace.
