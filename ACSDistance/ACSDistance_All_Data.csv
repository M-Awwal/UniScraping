Train as a consultant to help others control their anger.
This course aims to help you understand anger, and develop skills to deal with anger in:
The workplace.
With counselling clients.
In everyday life.
In your personal relationships.
Your own reactions.
Sporting situations.
And many more situations.
Whilst we tend to construe anger as a bad thing, anger involves both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are all too familiar i.e. thinking becomes clouded, you may become overly defensive, and you might act on your anger in a violent or aggressive way. The positive aspects which are often overlooked are that we often express our feelings when we otherwise might repress them, we have heightened energy levels due to physiological arousal, and we can often solve problems and take control whilst we are in this elevated state. The idea behind anger management is not to remove all anger, but to manage it by channelling it into the positive aspects and away from the negative aspects. If anger is expressed in acceptable and appropriate ways then it can be productive rather than destructive.
We all experience anger, though some people might be considered more bad tempered than others. Given that anger is a strong emotion, it can become too strong and over-bearing. When this happens, people may over-react. At such times it is possible to draw other people in and so the anger escalates. Anger management seeks to control exaggerated anger and channel it into constructive areas.
There are many anger management techniques ranging from relaxation exercises to changing thought patterns, learning how to communicate better to reducing stress levels. | ANGER MANAGEMENT

Tweet",ANGER MANAGEMENT,,"Develop your understanding of anger to help yourself control and improve your own anger.
Train as a consultant to help others control their anger.
This course aims to help you understand anger, and develop skills to deal with anger in:
The workplace.
With counselling clients.
In everyday life.
In your personal relationships.
Your own reactions.
Sporting situations.
And many more situations.
Whilst we tend to construe anger as a bad thing, anger involves both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are all too familiar i.e. thinking becomes clouded, you may become overly defensive, and you might act on your anger in a violent or aggressive way. The positive aspects which are often overlooked are that we often express our feelings when we otherwise might repress them, we have heightened energy levels due to physiological arousal, and we can often solve problems and take control whilst we are in this elevated state. The idea behind anger management is not to remove all anger, but to manage it by channelling it into the positive aspects and away from the negative aspects. If anger is expressed in acceptable and appropriate ways then it can be productive rather than destructive.
We all experience anger, though some people might be considered more bad tempered than others. Given that anger is a strong emotion, it can become too strong and over-bearing. When this happens, people may over-react. At such times it is possible to draw other people in and so the anger escalates. Anger management seeks to control exaggerated anger and channel it into constructive areas.
There are many anger management techniques ranging from relaxation exercises to changing thought patterns, learning how to communicate better to reducing stress levels. | ANGER MANAGEMENT

Study anger management by distance education. Learn to understand anger, and study the skills for managing anger and helping others manage anger as a counsellor, welfare worker or in health support.

The components of food used during exercise are to a degree, different to those components which may be used when not exercising. It therefore stands to reason that people who do more exercise may need to have and use different foods to those who do not exercise as much. The nutrition required for greater sporting activity can in this respect be different to the  nutrition required for less sporting activity.

This whole premise is however complicated by the fact that the physical characteristics (including genetics), will vary from one individual to another; and the nutritional components used in some sports will be different to those used in other sports. In effect, every situation is different; and this reason alone is why you need to understand sports nutrition in a holistic and scientific way, if you are to make appropriate choices about sports nutrition. | SPORTS NUTRITION

How to Select the Best Turf Grass
The number of grasses suitable for turf is limited.  Grass we use today is mostly selected and bred in Europe and the United States.  Holland is emerging as a world leader in turf grass breeding while in the United States, couch grass, particularly the hybrids, have been developed and are being used in sporting situations.
The intended or actual use of a particular area is the deciding factor in the selection of grass species and its subsequent management. The situation will vary from a feature lawn with a high maintenance cost to a park which is only mown when necessary.
When planning a seed mixture, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of different grasses and why certain grasses are used in preference to others.
Bent grasses and fescues such as Chewings and Creeping Red can withstand lower mowing than other grasses. The bent grass strains known as Penncross and Palustris are both stoloniferous and tend to become spongy with age.  If these bent grasses are used alone or with fescues in a lawn, bowling green or golf green, annual scarifying, preening and coring is essential for their maintenance. In a park or sports oval, these varieties of bent grass tend to colonise and form patches choking out all other grasses and giving a very patchy appearance.
Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) is a perennial.  It will not survive close mowing whilst winter grass (Poa annua) which is an annual will survive close mowing and can quickly become a serious weed.  It is also seeds prolifically.
The Bermuda couches are used extensively where there is heavy wear because they bind the surface together despite being dormant in winter.  It should be sewn in spring and summer.
Improved strains of perennial ryegrass with finer leaves have been developed for turf use. These strains have a deep strong root system and are easier to mow.
Tall fescue, also known as Demeter fescue, is a recent introduction to recreational areas although it has been in use as a pasture plant for a number of years.  It is a grass capable of withstanding severe wear and it has been used successfully in sports ovals and other areas where there is concentrated foot traffic. The finer fescues will persist in partially shaded areas for longer than other grass species, but in extreme shade no grass will persist.
Kikuyu can be used in situations where other grasses are destroyed by excessive wear, or where there is a limited water supply.  To prevent it developing a spongy surface, low mowing is necessary in either spring or autumn. This grass is either dormant or semi dormant in winter when it becomes yellow and this unsightly colouring has rendered it unacceptable as a sports surface.  Ryegrass, both perennial and annual, can be introduced in autumn to provide a more presentable appearance.

Train as a consultant to help others control their anger.
This course aims to help you understand anger, and develop skills to deal with anger in:
The workplace.
With counselling clients.
In everyday life.
In your personal relationships.
Your own reactions.
Sporting situations.
And many more situations.
Whilst we tend to construe anger as a bad thing, anger involves both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are all too familiar i.e. thinking becomes clouded, you may become overly defensive, and you might act on your anger in a violent or aggressive way. The positive aspects which are often overlooked are that we often express our feelings when we otherwise might repress them, we have heightened energy levels due to physiological arousal, and we can often solve problems and take control whilst we are in this elevated state. The idea behind anger management is not to remove all anger, but to manage it by channelling it into the positive aspects and away from the negative aspects. If anger is expressed in acceptable and appropriate ways then it can be productive rather than destructive.
We all experience anger, though some people might be considered more bad tempered than others. Given that anger is a strong emotion, it can become too strong and over-bearing. When this happens, people may over-react. At such times it is possible to draw other people in and so the anger escalates. Anger management seeks to control exaggerated anger and channel it into constructive areas.
There are many anger management techniques ranging from relaxation exercises to changing thought patterns, learning how to communicate better to reducing stress levels. | ANGER MANAGEMENT

On top of this, the oceans and air are increasingly affected by environmental decline.

The loss of species due to land degradation is also huge - more than 20,000 species are lost each year.  The world population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, with the increase concentrated mainly in developing countries - and with increased urbanisation within these countries.

All of this sounds like a very bleak scenario; and yet mankind continues to thrive. Sooner or later though; the sins of the past will catch up with everyone; and if we don't restore our environment, we will not continue to thrive as a species.

Tweet",ANGER MANAGEMENT,,"Develop your understanding of anger to help yourself control and improve your own anger.
Train as a consultant to help others control their anger.
This course aims to help you understand anger, and develop skills to deal with anger in:
The workplace.
With counselling clients.
In everyday life.
In your personal relationships.
Your own reactions.
Sporting situations.
And many more situations.
Whilst we tend to construe anger as a bad thing, anger involves both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are all too familiar i.e. thinking becomes clouded, you may become overly defensive, and you might act on your anger in a violent or aggressive way. The positive aspects which are often overlooked are that we often express our feelings when we otherwise might repress them, we have heightened energy levels due to physiological arousal, and we can often solve problems and take control whilst we are in this elevated state. The idea behind anger management is not to remove all anger, but to manage it by channelling it into the positive aspects and away from the negative aspects. If anger is expressed in acceptable and appropriate ways then it can be productive rather than destructive.
We all experience anger, though some people might be considered more bad tempered than others. Given that anger is a strong emotion, it can become too strong and over-bearing. When this happens, people may over-react. At such times it is possible to draw other people in and so the anger escalates. Anger management seeks to control exaggerated anger and channel it into constructive areas.
There are many anger management techniques ranging from relaxation exercises to changing thought patterns, learning how to communicate better to reducing stress levels. | ANGER MANAGEMENT

Tweet",SPORTS NUTRITION,,"When you exercise, you use up food that you have eaten. The components of food used during exercise are to a degree, different to those components which may be used when not exercising. It therefore stands to reason that people who do more exercise may need to have and use different foods to those who do not exercise as much. The nutrition required for greater sporting activity can in this respect be different to the  nutrition required for less sporting activity.

This whole premise is however complicated by the fact that the physical characteristics (including genetics), will vary from one individual to another; and the nutritional components used in some sports will be different to those used in other sports. In effect, every situation is different; and this reason alone is why you need to understand sports nutrition in a holistic and scientific way, if you are to make appropriate choices about sports nutrition. | SPORTS NUTRITION

Tweet",SPORTS NUTRITION,,"When you exercise, you use up food that you have eaten. The components of food used during exercise are to a degree, different to those components which may be used when not exercising. It therefore stands to reason that people who do more exercise may need to have and use different foods to those who do not exercise as much. The nutrition required for greater sporting activity can in this respect be different to the  nutrition required for less sporting activity.

This whole premise is however complicated by the fact that the physical characteristics (including genetics), will vary from one individual to another; and the nutritional components used in some sports will be different to those used in other sports. In effect, every situation is different; and this reason alone is why you need to understand sports nutrition in a holistic and scientific way, if you are to make appropriate choices about sports nutrition. | SPORTS NUTRITION

Tweet",ANGER MANAGEMENT,,"Develop your understanding of anger to help yourself control and improve your own anger.
Train as a consultant to help others control their anger.
This course aims to help you understand anger, and develop skills to deal with anger in:
The workplace.
With counselling clients.
In everyday life.
In your personal relationships.
Your own reactions.
Sporting situations.
And many more situations.
Whilst we tend to construe anger as a bad thing, anger involves both positive and negative aspects. The negative aspects are all too familiar i.e. thinking becomes clouded, you may become overly defensive, and you might act on your anger in a violent or aggressive way. The positive aspects which are often overlooked are that we often express our feelings when we otherwise might repress them, we have heightened energy levels due to physiological arousal, and we can often solve problems and take control whilst we are in this elevated state. The idea behind anger management is not to remove all anger, but to manage it by channelling it into the positive aspects and away from the negative aspects. If anger is expressed in acceptable and appropriate ways then it can be productive rather than destructive.
We all experience anger, though some people might be considered more bad tempered than others. Given that anger is a strong emotion, it can become too strong and over-bearing. When this happens, people may over-react. At such times it is possible to draw other people in and so the anger escalates. Anger management seeks to control exaggerated anger and channel it into constructive areas.
There are many anger management techniques ranging from relaxation exercises to changing thought patterns, learning how to communicate better to reducing stress levels. | ANGER MANAGEMENT

The nutrition required for greater sporting activity can in this respect be different to the  nutrition required for less sporting activity.

This whole premise is however complicated by the fact that the physical characteristics (including genetics), will vary from one individual to another; and the nutritional components used in some sports will be different to those used in other sports. In effect, every situation is different; and this reason alone is why you need to understand sports nutrition in a holistic and scientific way, if you are to make appropriate choices about sports nutrition. | SPORTS NUTRITION
