I also completed a Master of Arts, majoring in Corporate Communication and Public Relations. I decided to study at Bond, due to the ability to fast track my degrees and the small size of the university. I also loved the tight knit community! The best thing about studying at Bond is definitely the people, from the teachers to students and staff, the people are amazing. During my time at Bond, I met some of the greatest people from all over the world and created a close network. My experience at Bond was incredible! I lived on campus for the duration of my two degrees and from the moment I moved in, it felt like home. There was always something to do if I was not studying, like joining one of the great clubs on campus and meeting new people. When I first started at Bond, I was fortunate to meet a number of students who were partway through their degree and who have become friends and future contacts for my business. I completed a number of internships while at Bond, which were extremely helpful. For example, I interned in Singapore for one of the largest advertising agencies, Bond even allowed me to take the internship as a subject in my degree. Bond also helped me secure an internship in Melbourne through a previous student. I managed to organise several other internships independently and although Bond did not source these, they were extremely supportive and assisted me in every aspect. Since graduating from Bond I have founded two businesses. I am the Co-Founder/Director of the app ‘Be There Beauty’ and the Founder/Director of the social media management business, ‘So Social Australia’. Bond equipped me for these roles as I gained skills throughout my degrees that prepared me for the real world. Bond allowed me to connect with other previous students from around the world who also run their own business. Although I may not have known them while I was studying, the network that Bond has established helped me greatly. The main difference between Bond and other universities is that Bond is like a family. The Bond community supports each other during your studies and every day after. Everyone you meet is so nice and genuinely wants to keep in contact and remain part of the community. Attending Bond for two degrees was some of the best times of my life and I want to go back in the future to study, I wouldn’t go anywhere else after going to Bond. I would certainly recommend Bond to anyone and I do on a regular basis. It is a world-class institution that allows you to fast-track your degree, and start working and using the skills you have gained.  The first month at Bond I learnt skills I use every day at work. The teachers and fellow students are incredible and helped and continue to shape the reason why Bond is a fantastic university.

The world of project management is changing. Projects and programs are increasingly creative in nature, embedding innovative thinking, and dealing with complex business environments. Disruption and change management are becoming normal. A ‘management by projects’ approach, based on interdisciplinary team collaboration, is well suited to complex and / or innovative endeavours and is redefining hierarchical structures of corporate governance in the new gig economy. Innovation in project management, including adaptable practices (such as 'Agile' methodologies) that can respond quickly to opportunities, exploration of alternative solutions and the freedom to experiment, requires a new approach that is not constrained by conventional ideologies and the fear of failure. The parallel processes of innovation management and project management need to interact, new ways of working need to be applied where time is of the essence, and the benefits of design thinking within a diverse team environment must be realised. Innovation is an opportunity for project managers relating to their role in the initiate, implement or influence phases of the life cycle, especially for complex projects. It requires cross-disciplinary approach using creative and entrepreneurial skills and blending financial, social, political and environmental criteria to realise value for project stakeholders. It is a new way of thinking, and a desire to measure success not just in the delivery of projects but also taking account of good design and end-user delight. Projects must be progressive and generate collective utility. The Master of Project Innovation is designed to enhance graduate capabilities to meet future challenges in professional practice and up-skill knowledge over time. Dealing with increased project complexity and the risks of unforeseen consequences and impacts requires that the management of projects adopt a broader (systems thinking) approach. Project innovation is considered to be the next big thing for the project management discipline. Digital badges are growing in popularity for those already in the workforce and looking to up-skill or extend upon and formalise their skills, qualifications and experience. They are awarded to graduates of Project Innovation programs who have achieved at least a credit in a designated pair of core subjects, as shown below.
