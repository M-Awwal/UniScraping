In fact, however, it is increasingly the case that Church is seen not as a community of love but, rather, as a legalistic, dogmatic, mean-spirited and hypocritical institution.

What do leaders do? Are leaders born or made?,DETAILS FOR INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT,,"Most people like a job that is motivating and rewarding; a job that allows them to make a meaningful contribution; a job that allows them to learn and grow and to earn a fair salary. Not many people know how to design such jobs. Certainly as Christians we should ask ourselves the question: How can we create jobs and work environments that treat people as ‘made in the image of God’? This unit introduces the student to the key skills of management which includes the design of jobs, recruiting the right person for the job, team training, structuring the organisation, and designing fair compensation schemes, in order to equip them to create better jobs and job environments.",DETAILS FOR INTRODUCTION TO PASTORAL MINISTRY,,"In this introductory subject, students will explore a broad variety of topics that form the very basis of pastoral ministry.
