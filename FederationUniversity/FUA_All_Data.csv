Developing and maintaining academic momentum at university requires more than the adaption of existing study skills or the acquisition of new skills. It requires students to understand the nature of universities, their academic culture, and the different disciplinary requirements of academic study. Utilising the experiences of successful past students and international educational research, this course demystifies the nature, benefits and requirements of university study for new students. Topics include: the differences between studying at university and other learning environments; developing an appropriate student identity; the importance of developing an appreciation of disciplinary discourse conventions; how to conduct independent research; the centrality of critical thinking in university; the transferability and relevance of university learning skills to the workplace; and the educational and workplace benefits of graduate attributes.",Academic Writing (FASTP1015),,"After successfully completing this course students will have a greater understanding of the structure, uses and conventions of the more complex academic writing expected at university. Through the development of the skills necessary for clear written communication, students are equipped to successfully complete written academic assignments and begin to establish the foundations for the writing style needed by graduate professionals in the workplace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examining legislative requirements and how they align with, or challenge, social, cultural and political contexts, students will explore the meaning and understanding of diversity. With a focus on the development of practical approaches to address student strengths and abilities, this course examines inclusive approaches to learning and teaching such as Differentiation, Universal Design for Learning and Personalised Learning. Students will expand their skills in effectively designing meaningful learning plans which incorporate clear assessment of learner strengths and needs, associated SMART goals and personalised strategies for growth and development. Students will undertake an assessment task related to their chosen area of primary specialisation.",Diversity and Inclusion: Teaching Strategies for Diverse Learners (EDBED2010),,"This course examines elements of teaching and learning within a social justice and human rights framework. Students will explore learning environments, differentiation and practical strategies which support the access, participation and engagement of diverse learners. Emphasis is placed on strategies that support wellbeing and safety within the educational setting and align with expectations of policy, curriculum and legislation. Particular attention is directed toward building the capacity of students to identify and accommodate attributes of difference within their planning. Opportunities will be provided for students to explore barriers that may impact wellbeing and educational success, and identify teaching strategies that are responsive to the strengths and needs of learners from diverse backgrounds. Students will consider academic, social and personal needs along with the purpose and benefits of a range of educational strategies, scaffolds and supports to design safe, supportive and effective learning environments.",Professional Experience: Final (EEZED4721),,This course supports the final professional experience in the Bachelor of Education in which students complete 30 days (or as required for program) in the education setting specified below for their particular program. PSTs are required to complete the expectations outlined in Professional Experience Assessment Report (Form A). Assessment of PST achievement against all Australian Professional Standards for Teachers is undertaken at the completion of the placement by the Mentor Teacher. Students will record reflections on their learning by completing the reflective Self-Evaluation Report (Form C). This will take place in collaboration with their school-based Mentor Teacher in the education setting in which the placement occurs (as indicated below).

This course examines the role of knowledge experts in disciplinary fields and professions, the creation of new knowledge, the function and processes of knowledge communication, as well as the intended - and unintended - consequences of the use of knowledge. The importance of a personal and professional evaluation of knowledge is emphasised as central to the development of responsible citizens in an increasingly global knowledge economy and society.",Understanding University Learning (ATSGC1369),,"Through a critical examination of student transitions into university new students gain an understanding of the skills, attitudes and behaviours necessary to experience success in higher education. Developing and maintaining academic momentum at university requires more than the adaption of existing study skills or the acquisition of new skills. It requires students to understand the nature of universities, their academic culture, and the different disciplinary requirements of academic study. Utilising the experiences of successful past students and international educational research, this course demystifies the nature, benefits and requirements of university study for new students. Topics include: the differences between studying at university and other learning environments; developing an appropriate student identity; the importance of developing an appreciation of disciplinary discourse conventions; how to conduct independent research; the centrality of critical thinking in university; the transferability and relevance of university learning skills to the workplace; and the educational and workplace benefits of graduate attributes.",Academic Writing (FASTP1015),,"After successfully completing this course students will have a greater understanding of the structure, uses and conventions of the more complex academic writing expected at university.
