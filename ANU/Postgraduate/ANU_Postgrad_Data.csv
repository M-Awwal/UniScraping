From quantum field theory to general relativity, theoretical physics not only answers the most fundamental questions of our existence, but is also at the forefront of scientific discovery.Take gravitational waves for example. Researchers at The Australian National University supplied equipment and techniques used in the detection of gravitational waves, opening up a new avenue for astronomical discovery. This global scientific collaboration was the culmination of a 100-year journey that started with Einstein’s theory of general relativity.The Master of Science in Theoretical Physics brings students to the cutting edge of research in an interactive training environment, being taught by some of the world’s leading theoretical physicists. You will discover the breadth of theoretical physics, including understanding how non-linear dynamics can be applied to complex problems.If you are interested in big questions, like how the universe works or how elementary particles interact with each other to form nuclei and stars, then you will enjoy learning about quantum field theory. With applications such as particle physics and condensed matter, quantum field theory is arguably the most far-reaching attempt to combine special relativity and quantum physics in a unique framework.Drawing on world leading expertise from the ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering, this program will provide you with the techniques and skills necessary for a bright future in research or related careers in education, science and industry.","demonstrate high level knowledge in theoretical physics and its methods; apply their knowledge in theoretical physics to new problems; interpret, synthesize and critically analyse published literature of relevance to theoretical physics; demonstrate theoretical and/or practical skills relevant to techniques and research methodology in theoretical physics; critically analyse data within applications of theoretical physics to reach independent conclusions; demonstrate a critical understanding of science in society; clearly communicate theory and results in both written and oral formats.",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,For domestic fees and details on Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) see:  http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/costs-fees
