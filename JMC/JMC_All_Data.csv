Motion Designer",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"I'm not good at drawing - can I still apply for the Animation course?
Yes. We offer multiple pathways into the course regardless of your current drawing abilities and art is one of these pathways. If you don't feel all too comfortable drawing, we offer pathways in technical and conceptual skills.
Do I need to bring in a portfolio to apply for Animation, and if so, what should I put in it?
A portfolio essentially relates to samples of your work. If you have nice finished artwork, that's fantastic, but not essential. What we're looking for is that you have a drive to create things and are passionate about the field, so show us that in your portfolio. Things like sketches or drawings, notes, ideas and characters you've invented are all great.
How can I increase my chances of finding employment upon graduation?
Building your network with like-minded people and meeting people in the industry is really important. We encourage you to attend industry talks and events (many of which are held on campus) and introduce yourself to people. Amazing opportunities often arise through those connections so be open to new experiences. Create your own opportunities as well. If there's nothing else happening, keep working. Work on your own projects and set yourself tasks to enhance and refine your skills so you not only have great content to add to your showreel, but when an opportunity does come up, you're ready to seize it.
What projects will I create during the Animation course that I can show future employers?
In the course of completing the Bachelor degree you will complete multiple key creative projects, both solo and in teams, as well as a host of smaller exercises. You will build your portfolio with polished work from your second trimester onwards and your last two trimesters will be devoted to a major project that will showcase your talent and abilities. | "

Musical Theatre Director",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"I don't play an instrument. Can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
I'm not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you'll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won't have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn't your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you're auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you're comfortable with and know well. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you've brought everything you need. Don't stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you've got...keeping in mind that we don't expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!

This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you'll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won't have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn't your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you're auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you're comfortable with and know well. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Don't base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you've brought everything you need. Don't stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you've got...keeping in mind that we don't expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!

Yes, while the content covers a range of arts management areas, there is a large focus on events, touring and festivals.

 ",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"I have no experience in making games (although I have played many). Will I be able to do well in the Game Design course?
It's your compulsion to create, tell stories and discover new forms of play that we're really looking for, and we teach the course from beginner level up so you're in good hands.
Is the Game Design course more focused on design or development?
The Game course is primarily focused on art and design, but we recognise that a familiarity with scripting and programming is a key part of the skillset of a game artist, and you will certainly learn skills in those areas as well.
The emphasis is on understanding the theory behind games, designing interesting challenges, mechanics, concepts and stories, and creating the art and assets for those concepts. You would be studying a mix of art and design, software and programming skills, and theoretical concepts.
Are there any work experience/internship opportunities specific to the Game Design course?
While the availability of internships and work placements depends on the individual companies and studios in the industry, we have strong relationships with many practising game designers and game studios. As a result of these connections there is the potential for you to experience internships and placements, studio visits, talks and workshops by industry practitioners, and assessment feedback opportunities from industry people during dedicated 'speed networking' nights. Where practical, interviews will be arranged for individual graduating students with companies seeking to recruit new talent.
What software programs will I use in the Game Course?
Applications used in the Game Design course include Maya for modelling and animation, MotionBuilder for motion capture, Substance Painter & Designer for texturing and ZBrush for digital sculpture. | "

It's your compulsion to create, tell stories and discover new forms of play that we're really looking for, and we teach the course from beginner level up so you're in good hands.
Is the Game Design course more focused on design or development?
The Game course is primarily focused on art and design, but we recognise that a familiarity with scripting and programming is a key part of the skillset of a game artist, and you will certainly learn skills in those areas as well.
The emphasis is on understanding the theory behind games, designing interesting challenges, mechanics, concepts and stories, and creating the art and assets for those concepts. You would be studying a mix of art and design, software and programming skills, and theoretical concepts.
Are there any work experience/internship opportunities specific to the Game Design course?
While the availability of internships and work placements depends on the individual companies and studios in the industry, we have strong relationships with many practising game designers and game studios. As a result of these connections there is the potential for you to experience internships and placements, studio visits, talks and workshops by industry practitioners, and assessment feedback opportunities from industry people during dedicated 'speed networking' nights. Where practical, interviews will be arranged for individual graduating students with companies seeking to recruit new talent.
What software programs will I use in the Game Course?

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you're booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn't your strong point.  
I'm not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you'll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won't have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | "

An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you're booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn't your strong point.  
I'm not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you'll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won't have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | "
