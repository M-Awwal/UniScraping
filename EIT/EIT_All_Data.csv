6 Apr 2021 |  | ",Closed Loop Motion Control Systems,"1.   Remotely control a servomotor driven by a closed loop motor controller
  2.   Optimize the stiffness, accuracy and stability of the system
  3.   Apply tests to check system stability
  4.   Perform advanced tuning
  5.   Perform backlash compensation
 ","A closed-loop control system is a system in which an input forcing function is determined in part by the response of the system. The measured response of the physical system is then compared with a desired response, and the difference between these two responses initiates actions that will result in the actual response of the system to approach the desired one. Aircraft autopilots or missile guidance systems are good examples of closed-loop control systems. Most engineers and technicians from a process control environment will be familiar with PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) closed-loop control. However, this module will examine closed-loop (PID) control from a Mechatronics/Robotics perspective and focus primarily on closed-loop motion control systems.
   ",Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs),"1.   Select appropriate PLC for a given application
  2.   Develop PLC programs
   ","A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is a digital computer used for the automation of electromechanical processes. Examples of such processes include machinery on factory assembly lines, or light fixtures. PLCs are used in many industrial applications. Unlike general-purpose computers, they are designed for multiple input and output (I/O) arrangements. They can withstand extreme temperatures, they are immune to electrical noise, and resistant to vibration and impact. Their control programs are typically stored in battery-backed or non-volatile memory. This module covers PLC hardware and programming techniques, including ladder logic, function blocks and sequential function chart as per IEC61131-3.
   ",Embedded Systems,"1.   Demonstrate the difference between various PIC programming approaches
  2.   Develop a PIC program to control a mobile robot
   ","An 'embedded system' is a computer system designed for specific control functions, often within a larger system. It is embedded as part of a complete device, often including hardware and mechanical parts. At the core of the system is a microprocessor or microcontroller. A microcontroller is a small self-contained computer implanted on a single Integrated Circuit (IC). It contains a processor, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. Some form of program memory is often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. These controllers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the larger microprocessors used in PCs and other general purpose applications. Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices such as automobile fuel injection systems, robots, and toys. Mixed signal microcontrollers are common, integrating analog components to control non-digital electronic systems.
   ",Industrial Robotic Arms,"1.   Perform calculations for robot arms
2.   Examine and discuss sensing, vision and safety issues for industrial robot arms
3.   Control a robot arm","An industrial robot is defined by the International Organization for Standardization as an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes. Robotics is a subset of Mechatronics and may be defined (at least in the manufacturing industry) as the study, design and use of robot systems for manufacturing. Typical applications of robots include welding, painting, assembly, packaging, palletizing, surface mounting (SMT), product inspection, and testing. All this can be performed 24/7 with speed and precision.
   ",Machine Communication Technologies,"1.   Describe the basics of serial communications
  2.   Discuss the hardware and protocols for networked communications
  3.   Compare the technologies used for short-range wireless communications
  4.   Examine the use of field buses for machine communication","Data communications in all its facets, be that analog or digital, wired or wireless, underpins the operation of the entire modern production plant, and hence most industrial Mechatronics applications. However, even with educational robotics there is a need to download software from a PC or laptop to the robot. Wireless technologies are used to communicate with mobile robots, whereas industrial robots employed in the manufacturing Industry typically communicate via a field bus. This unit will cover both wired and wireless technologies, ranging from the ‘old’ RS-232 standard to the latest Ethernet-based technologies.

   ","The four basic disciplines that underpin Mechatronics are electronic systems, mechanical systems, computers, and control systems. Electronic systems can further be subdivided into analog and digital electronic systems. However, the understanding of both analog and digital systems depends on a fundamental knowledge of electricity and the way it behaves in passive circuits. This unit deals with the behavior of passive (i.e. non-electronic) circuits comprising resistors (R), capacitors (C) or inductors (L), or a combination thereof, in the presence of either Direct Current (DC) or Alternating Current (AC).

This includes SSI devices such as logic gates, and MSI devices such as flip-flops, shift registers and counters. The study of these devices is not be limited to theory; delegates will design and simulate circuits with computer software, and then physically (optionally) build and test them in order to verify the design and simulation. 
   ",Actuators,1.      Examine and discuss the actuators used in Mechatronics applications,"A large range of actuators is used in Mechatronics applications. Without them, robots of any kind would simply not exist. This module covers the whole spectrum of actuators (primarily electric), including both linear and rotary actuators. Rotary actuators include AC and DC motors of various types such as stepper motors and servos. Linear electrical actuators include both AC and DC types, as well as electro-hydraulic and electro-pneumatic actuators. This module will also address the electronic drive systems for these actuators.
   ",Programming Languages,"1.  Develop the program for a given robotics control function
 ","Programming languages are artificial languages designed to communicate instructions to machines, particularly computers. These languages are used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine, and/or to express algorithms precisely. This module will deal with a few languages commonly used for developing robotics control programs.
   ",Machine Sensors,"1.   Examine and discuss the functionality and signal conditioning for robot sensors
2.   Add sensors to a mobile robot ","Sensors are essential for autonomous robots as they are the only means for the robot to observe itself as well as its immediate environment. Basic robots can get away with as little as one sensor, although the number of sensors increases and they become more diverse as robots become more and more sophisticated. There is a wide variety of commercially available sensors, including those for observing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), forces, acceleration, angular displacement and distance; to name but a few. The main challenge for the robot designer is not so much finding an appropriate sensor, as these are freely available nowadays, but to condition the sensor signal and interface it with the controller unit so that the robot can make decisions based on the sensor output.
   ",Robot Mechanics,"1.   Perform static analyses on robot design
 ","‘Statics’ is the branch of the theory of machines and mechanisms concerned with the analysis of loads such as force and torque on physical systems that are in static equilibrium. Static equilibrium refers to a state where the relative position of a system does not vary over time. It also refers to a system of which the components and structures are moving at a constant velocity.  ‘Dynamics’, on the other hand, studies the motion of machines and mechanisms, taking into account the forces acting on them.
  This module addresses both static and dynamic issues related to robots, as well as the associated energy requirements and the selection of batteries for mobile robots.

  2.   Select appropriate system components
  3.   Create robot vision applications
 ","Machine vision has progressed in leaps and bounds since the eighties, with tremendous results achievable today. Modern machine vision systems are highly effective and form a key part of many industrial systems, ranging from mineral processing to manufacturing. This module covers the fundamentals of image processing and machine vision to give participants a solid foundation to work from. It will show how to select and integrate all the various components into a professional and working system. The module will be presented with minimal use of mathematics and extensive use of practical concepts and applications.

  4.   Explain the basics of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to Analog-Converters (DACs) 
 ","Electronics forms one of the main pillars supporting Mechatronics systems. The electronics discipline can further be subdivided into two sub-disciplines, viz. analog and digital electronics.  This module covers both the operation and application of discrete components (such as diodes and transistors) and integrated components (such as operational amplifiers). The study of these devices will not be limited to theory. Delegates will have the chance to design and simulate circuits with computer software, and then to (optionally) physically build them in order to verify the design and simulated results. 
   ",Robot Kinematics,"1.   Perform matrix calculations
  2.   Apply the Denavit-Hartenberg notation to robot arms
  3.   Perform Forward/Reverse matrix translations
   ","Robot Kinematics studies the relationship between the dimensions and interconnection of kinematic chains (e.g. the parts of a robotic arm) and the position, velocity and acceleration of each of the links in the system. This needs to be done in order to plan and control movement and to compute forces and torques in the system. The links of the robot are modeled as rigid bodies, and the joints are assumed to provide pure rotation or pure translation.
  'Forward Kinematics' refers the computation of a position by taking into account the angles of translation and rotation of the various components, while 'Inverse Kinematics refers to the opposite i.e. the translation of position to angles. 
   ",Remote (Online) Engineering,"1.   Examine and discuss the use of Remote (Online) Technologies in contemporary applications
 ","Remote Engineering, also referred to as Online Engineering, is a recent development in Engineering and Science. Its aim is to facilitate the shared use of equipment, resources, and specialized software such as simulators.  The International Association of Online Engineering (IAOE) is an international non-profit organization. Its objective is to encourage the wider development, distribution and application of Online Engineering (OE). The main forum of the OE community is the annual International Conference on Remote Engineering and Virtual Instrumentation ('REV').
  
According to the IAOE the reasons for the growing importance of sharing engineering resources include the growing complexity of engineering tasks; the increasing proliferation of specialized and expensive equipment as well as software tools and simulators; the need for expensive equipment and software tools/simulators in short-lived projects; the application of high-tech equipment even in small and medium-sized enterprises; the need for highly-qualified staff to control new equipment, and the demands of globalization and division of labor.
  This module will create an awareness of technologies and trends in the area of Remote Engineering.

 ","The objective of this module is to outline the best practice in designing, installing, commissioning and troubleshooting industrial data communications systems. In any given plant, factory or installation there are a myriad of different industrial communications standards used and the key to successful implementation is the degree to which the entire system integrates and works together.
  With the vast number of different technologies and standards currently on the market, the debate is not “what is the best”, but rather how does industry assess and select the most appropriate for given applications. The next challenge is to ensure that best practice is followed in designing, installing and commissioning the data communication links to ensure they run fault-free.
  The industrial data communications systems in a plant underpin the entire operation. It is critical that personnel apply best practice in designing, installing, troubleshooting and fixing any problems that may occur.  The most critical component of any industrial data communications system is, in fact, the medium (i.e. the fiver or copper cable). This module outlines the critical rules followed in installing the data communications media, and then ensuring that the installation will be trouble-free for years to come.
  Delegates are not required to know the minute details of the actual protocols used, but rather how to select, install and maintain the system in the most cost-effective and beneficial manner.

      Bloom’s Level 5","In many developed nations the existing built infrastructure is approaching or has already exceeded its original design life.  In some cases, this infrastructure has been categorised as having heritage status, and depending on the age of the structure it is often found that little is known about the original design or the current condition of the constituent structural materials. In addition, most structures typically degrade over time whilst at the same time being subjected to larger magnitudes of loading than was originally intended.  For these reasons the study of the structural characteristics of existing infrastructure is more complex than the design of new infrastructure.

The billions of dollars’ worth of public and private resources invested in rail track infrastructure around the world demand a well-trained and competent engineering workforce for the safe and efficient operation of the track and associated assets. However, developments over the past twenty years, such as downsizing of public railway authorities, increased retirement of experienced employees, privatization, and the rapid expansion of the rail industry have left engineers with severely limited pathways to upskill themselves quickly.
This degree has been developed by railway experts to address the specific needs of the industry. The industry focus of the degree is enhanced through the expectation that students will be employed in the railway industry during all or part of their studies. The units in this master’s degree were structured with this very purpose in mind.
This optimal mix of academic and industry-based learning provides engineers with more advanced skills and knowledge much faster than workplace training can do.
Through EIT’s online delivery, railway engineers can study the degree from anywhere in the world. The blend of differing railway contexts, operating standards, practices, and policies experienced by these engineers living in many countries will provide a unique learning opportunity for them as they interact with each other throughout the degree.
Despite the very diverse locations of railway infrastructure engineers, the course coordinators and lecturers work hard to build a sense of professional community among the students.
The program is delivered using a wide range of learning activities such as live webinars, written assignments, case studies, team projects, remote laboratories, and more. These experiences aim to get the students interacting via technology-based learning experiences that highlight shared skills and knowledge derived from the many cultural and technical contexts in which the students are working.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Bloom’s Level 6","Although this is a Masters Program by coursework, this unit, the Masters Thesis is a significant component. Naturally, this thesis work is considerably less than that undertaken on a full research master degree. In this unit the student has to draw upon the knowledge and skill base developed in the preceding units, and take a significant step forward in applying technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse, and theorise about developments that contribute to professional practice or scholarship and to make a novel contribution to the field of interest. It does require a significant amount of dedicated and persistent work to complete the thesis to the appropriate level.
As a significant research component of the program, this unit will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills – with creativity and initiative to new situations in professional practice and/or for further learning; with high level personal autonomy and accountability; and to plan and execute a substantial research-based project, capstone experience and/or piece of scholarship.
Students are required to choose their own project; however, the project will have to be approved by an academic panel to ensure academic integrity and a Master’s-level scope. It is important that the topic selected is aligned with the student’s interest, future career goals, work history, possible support from an employer, or serious interest in contributing to a particular field.
Research methods are taught within this unit building on the unit entitled ‘Engineering Research & Practice’. The role of the supervisor is to guide and facilitate; it is his/her wisdom that is made available to the student to complete the thesis. The structure of the Masters program is such that there are a number of mini projects integrated into the other independent units. It is also through these mini projects, as well as through the research-based assignments within these units, that research skills are taught and built upon incrementally.
There is a dedicated unit entitled “Engineering Practice and Key Research Methods” which builds a strong foundation of research practice. This prior and required learning is drawn upon and extended throughout this program.
Furthermore, a wide ranging but brief introduction is given on good practice in research techniques over three online sessions of approximately one hour each.

A powerful force is driving industrial growth and change, and it’s only getting stronger. That force? Uncertainty. Society increasingly demands more efficient transport, more power production, safer energy exploration and processing, less waste, smarter products, and of course, all at lower costs. All these demands display uncertainty and how we need to manage it through engineering, science, and technology.
In the 21st century, industry will routinely deal with novel hazardous processing technologies, complex energy grid load-balancing from renewables, driverless cars, artificial vision to augment control, and feedback in sub-sea exploration – and the infinitesimal scale of nanotechnologies in bionic engineering. Currently, people are at the heart of many hazardous work environments, exposed to the consequences of uncontrolled events. Still, soon, artificial intelligence will afford more human tasks to be automated (and present a host of newer risks in exchange for the retired ones). This progress has to be examined in systematic terms – terms that integrate our understandings of technical fallibility, human error, and political decision-making.
This program has been carefully designed to accomplish three key goals. First, a set of fundamental concepts is described in useful, manageable ways that encourage rapid and integrated knowledge-acquisition.
Second, that knowledge is applied in creative and imaginative ways to afford practical, career-oriented advantages. Third, the learning that results from the integration of knowledge and application is encouraged by activities and projects, culminating in a project thesis that is the capstone of the program.
This carefully designed learning journey will develop an accurate understanding and also exercise the participant’s creativity and design-thinking capabilities. Employers are hungry for these skills, and program graduates can expect a significant advantage when interacting with employers, clients, consultants, and fellow engineering peers.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Bloom’s Level 6
5. Design, develop and present their thesis at an advanced academic level
Bloom’s Level 6","Although this is a Masters Program by coursework, this unit, the Masters Thesis is a significant component. Naturally, this thesis work is considerably less than that undertaken on a full research master degree. In this unit the student has to draw upon the knowledge and skill base developed in the preceding units, and take a significant step forward in applying technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse, and theorise about developments that contribute to professional practice or scholarship and to make a novel contribution to the field of interest. It does require a significant amount of dedicated and persistent work to complete the thesis to the appropriate level.
As a significant research component of the program, this unit will demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills – with creativity and initiative to new situations in professional practice and/or for further learning; with high level personal autonomy and accountability; and to plan and execute a substantial research-based project, capstone experience and/or piece of scholarship.
Students are required to choose their own project; however, the project will have to be approved by an academic panel to ensure academic integrity and a Master’s-level scope. It is important that the topic selected is aligned with the student’s interest, future career goals, work history, possible support from an employer, or serious interest in contributing to a particular field.
Research methods are taught within this unit building on the unit entitled ‘Engineering Research & Practice’. The role of the supervisor is to guide and facilitate; it is his/her wisdom that is made available to the student to complete the thesis. The structure of the Masters program is such that there are a number of mini projects integrated into the other independent units. It is also through these mini projects, as well as through the research-based assignments within these units, that research skills are taught and built upon incrementally.
There is a dedicated unit entitled “Engineering Practice and Key Research Methods” which builds a strong foundation of research practice. This prior and required learning is drawn upon and extended throughout this program.
Furthermore, a wide ranging but brief introduction is given on good practice in research techniques over three online sessions of approximately one hour each. This will enable the Master Thesis to proceed with a strong underpinning of the essentials of best practice in research. The student will be expected to read and review considerably more than in each of the one hour interactive tutorial sessions.",SAFETY SYSTEMS – TOOLS AND METHODS,"

In parallel, other industries’ focus has evolved from personal safety to high reliability organizations (HRO). However more complex processes require more complex safety technology. HH Fawcett said ‘To know is to survive and to ignore fundamentals is to court disaster.’ Until recent times (start of the 21st century), safety emphasis was on worker safety. In recent times safety (or process safety) has been replaced by emphasis on loss prevention. In Chemical Process Safety, the terms safety, hazard and risk are defined as:","THE SAFETY LIFECYCLE, RISK REDUCTION AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT",,"THE SAFETY LIFECYCLE, RISK REDUCTION AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT",ASSET INTEGRITY AND MANAGEMENT,"

4. Investigate Government Regulations and Safety oversight requirements
5. Reflect on a Safety System Review and Audit – ‘Waterfall Rail Accident’
6. Improving oversight through System Safety – ‘US Federal Aviation Administration’","System Safety can be defined in simple language as “organised common sense [George Mueller]”. It is a planned, disciplined and systematic approach to identifying, analysing, eliminating and controlling hazards by analysis, design and management procedures throughout a system’s life cycle. System Safety starts at the earliest concept development stages and continues through the design, production, testing, operational use and disposal stages. Risk Management on the other hand aims to control an existing or an emerging process, policy, device that acts to minimize negative risk or enhance positive opportunities. It is accepted that all risks cannot be eliminated completely i.e., there will be some residual risk. Risk assessments aim to determine how much risk remains and then to make convincing arguments for accepting the residual risk or reduced reliability (e.g. excessive cost to ensure 100% supply reliability as compared to reasonable cost to ensure 98% supply reliability, and understanding when the difference between 98% and 100% is trivial or vital). “We all know that safety should be an integral part of the systems that we build and operate. The public demands that they are protected from accidents and the following consequences, yet the two main constituents – industry and government – do not always know how to reach this common goal”.",ENGINEERING PRACTICE AND KEY RESEARCH METHODS,"

Electrical safety is a critical issue for those working on electrical facilities in utility networks and large industrial installations. Several serious accidents, including fatalities, occur every. Arc flashes in electrical equipment are now considered one of the major causes of electrical accidents — even surpassing the well-known hazards of electric shock.
Avoiding arc flash incidents and the resulting injuries is one of the biggest challenges facing electrical workers. It requires adequate attention in the stages of system planning, design, installation, operation, and maintenance. Today, a considerable body of knowledge exists as a result of research efforts, and is available to designers and maintenance engineers in the form of standards such as IEEE 1584 and NFPA 70E.
This course will detail the basis of this approach, and also the significant advances that have been made in the area of Personal Protective Equipment made of Fire Resistant fabrics and rated for different levels of thermal exposure.
Prevention, however, remains the best form of protection, and switchgear manufacturers have made considerable design advances to ensure that the effect of arc flash incidents is contained within the enclosure of switchgear (often called arc flash resistant switchgear). Methods of testing such switchgear have also evolved simultaneously.
Another critical factor is the approach to avoid arc incidents within the switchgear by proper design and maintenance and techniques to reduce the severity of the flash should such incidents occur. These will form the key focus areas of this course.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Python is an object-oriented generic programming language that is particularly suited to the modern world. It is an excellent choice for introducing fundamental programming concepts as it reduces the complexity of problem-solving by hiding the intricate arcane detail ‘under the hood.’ Python can do in a single line what many programming languages require multiple lines of code to achieve.
Automation of tasks is a critical part of every engineer’s jobs today. Design probably only takes 10 percent of an engineer’s time — most of the day-to-day work is in research, testing of prototypes, debugging, production testing, and documentation. Python is now increasingly used in the automation and embedded systems world. Specific tasks for Python include testing, data collection, and automation.
Therefore, there is a growing need for Python programming skills by industry (typically manufacturing, mining, healthcare, and energy). This program focuses on giving you a solid foundation in the use of this language. This allows you to leave the program with a strong capability in programming with Python, rather than superficially skimming through the language. Naturally, you will need to apply your knowledge to engineering tasks to extend and solidify your proficiency.
This program focuses on specific engineering disciplines: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, industrial automation, and civil engineering.
Electrical Engineering applications include file processing (conversion from one format to another such as XML to CSV), automation of test equipment and data (such as waveforms for power quality problems), and database management (such as SQL).
Mechanical Engineering is often considered to be disconnected from the need for programming knowledge. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Areas such as numerical analysis (with awkward boundary conditions) in manufacturing, automotive, energy spheres of activity, and thermodynamics (ranging from fluid dynamics to chemical kinetics) require programming knowledge. It is also imperative in computational fluid dynamics.
Civil Engineering applications include risk assessment and mitigation for floods, cyclones, earthquakes, prediction of traffic trends, stress analysis of data from bridges, analysis of vast amounts of geotechnical data.
Industrial Automation application includes analysis of vast amounts of data from processes, logging data over a Modbus communication link, and preventative maintenance. It also includes translating a PLC database and converting this into a bunch of HTML files.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Construction is the largest industry in the world. Within a civil engineering context, construction may refer to bridges, dams, earthworks, foundations, offshore structures, pipelines, power stations, railways, retaining structures, roads, tunnels, waterways, and water or wastewater infrastructures.
Anything constructed needs to be designed first. Structural engineering deals with the analysis and design aspects required to ensure a safe, functional, and economical end product. During the design process, the designer may regularly interact with specialists such as architects and operational managers. Once the design is finalized, the implementation requires people to handle aspects such as statutory approvals, planning, quality assurance, and material procurement.
The entire exercise can be undertaken in a highly-coordinated way if everyone involves understands the terminology or ‘project language.’ To fully understand this language, it is necessary to appreciate the principles of structural analysis and design.
Participants in this course will gain a basic knowledge of structural engineering that includes the principles of analysis of structures and their application, the behavior of materials under loading, the selection of construction materials, and the design fundamentals for Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) and steel structures. The emphasis will be on the determination of the nature and quantum of stress developed under loads, and the way structures offer resistance to it.

Substations are critical assets in any power system and serve as important nodes in a transmission and distribution network. Substations, therefore, handle multiple voltages in a given location and link two or more systems of different voltages.
This course will focus on subsystems that perform essential functions in substations. These include earthing and grounding, lightning protection of outdoor equipment and substation buildings, power system protection, control, and interlocking equipment, including the auxiliary power sources and various switchyard facilities. These include foundation, structures, cable routing, lighting, fire protection and surveillance equipment.
Earthing of a high voltage switchyard requires careful design as it has a direct bearing on safety. The design approach to switchyards will be discussed, and the basic methods of calculation will be outlined. Lightning is a common threat to substation equipment and supply reliability, as overvoltage surges can result in insulation failure or spark over. While lightning cannot be prevented, its effects can be minimized by proper lightning and surge protection measures.
Any electrical equipment is susceptible to insulation failures. Protection against such failures and the resulting short circuits is a vital need in power systems. The various protection options available to the designer and the protection of busbars, transformers, and substation feeders will be discussed.
Another essential system is the control of switchyard equipment and the required auxiliary power supply. AC auxiliary power is used for the operation of isolators and disconnectors, the operating mechanism of circuit breakers, and substation lighting. The essential functions are powered through DC supply backed with batteries for reliability. This includes control, annunciation and protection functions, breaker close and trip commands, and in some cases, emergency lighting.
A switchyard has to be adequately planned by preparing the site, measuring earth resistivity required for earthing design and optimization, earthwork, foundations, cable trenches inside the switchyard, draining arrangements, etc. These aspects will be covered in detail during the course. We will also discuss gas-insulated switchgear as an alternative to outdoor open type switchyards.
This course will also cover selecting and applying appropriate power system protection to protect equipment and personnel from abnormal system conditions, including short circuits and earth faults.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES

Depending on the functions performed by a substation, the configuration and complexity can be quite varied. The skill of the designer is to anticipate the present and future needs that the substation will cater to, select appropriate design configuration, and calculate the ratings of main equipment such as busbars, transformers, and switchgear to ensure trouble-free service over several decades.
Sufficient thought should be given to the need for maintaining critical substation equipment, and appropriate redundancies must be planned as well. This is essential as otherwise the consumers fed by the substation can suffer frequent supply outages, which is undesirable from both a service and a financial point of view.
It is also necessary to ensure that the substation will work satisfactorily under various normal and not-so-normal situations (such as short circuits and other types of abnormal events that can occur in a system) without any failures. This is done through various calculations that are performed to reflect a set of simulated conditions. These calculations are collectively called as system studies. The type of studies will depend upon the complexity and criticality of the substation and the loads connected to it. The simulations are carried out using specialized computer software.
A designer should have a clear understanding of the studies that need to be performed in a given case and should also be able to decide the conditions that need to be simulated for each study. System studies can often bring out problem areas in the design. These need to be addressed by appropriate solutions involving equipment for voltage improvement, fault limiters, and flicker compensation.
Modern industries give rise to sizeable harmonic components, which can result in premature equipment failures by heating and or harmonic resonance. Harmonic filters and other measures to inhibit resonance will have to be planned in such cases.
These studies, when performed at the design stage, permit the designer to include the required corrective equipment proactively and integrate them with the rest of the system by providing proper space and switchgear as a part of the substation design, rather than as an afterthought.
This practical course will cover these complex issues through a simple step-by-step approach and real-life examples. At each step, you will undertake a basic design approach and perform calculations to ensure you get practical skills that can be immediately implemented in the workplace.",,Australia,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,"INTAKES
