It brings together the social and environmental sciences to study pressing issues such as the human dimensions of climate and environmental change; rising urban and regional inequalities; and sustainability and disaster resilience in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. 
Geographers are uniquely positioned to respond to mounting social and ecological crises by having the skills and knowledge to pursue more just, sustainable and resilient futures.  Geography careers are found in public, private and community sectors, working in areas such as: sustainability and sustainable development, community development, climate change, public policy, social and environmental consultancies, disaster management, land-use management, education and higher-degree research.
Through this major you will develop skills in synthesising social and biophysical information to develop practical strategies oriented at tackling the big social and environmental challenges of our time.  You will experience a field school in your second year and explore Sydney as a living laboratory throughout your studies. You will learn to think critically and apply important concepts including environmental justice, community resilience and Indigenous knowledges to improve public policy and decision-making.","PROFESSIONS: Cartographer and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analyst.

Global change is a driving force for emerging infectious disease. A growing human population, increased global connectivity, urbanisation, climate change and intensive farming practices are examples of changes that create a greater connection between people, animals, plants and the disease agents each carry. These connections create opportunities for emergence of infectious disease. Biosecurity is how we prevent and control for emerging infectious disease, and is a means to protecting the planet’s resources.
This major explores the effects of human activity and global change as drivers of emerging infectious diseases, and will equip you with the knowledge and skills to tackle these major issues. You’ll study the significance of the intersection between humans and the environment, wildlife and domestic animals in disease dynamics, and how this is relevant to health biosecurity. You’ll develop skills in applying disease transmission theory to epidemiology, in the lab and in devising a biosecurity response plan.

Physicists apply the laws of physics to contribute to fields such as astronomy, biology, communications, electronics and engineering. 
In this major, you’ll become knowledgeable about fundamental physics concepts and principles, and develop skills in problem solving, numerical analysis, lab techniques, technical writing and oral communication. As you explore basic questions about the intrinsic laws of the universe and learn how physics is applied to interdisciplinary fields, you’ll apply core physical principles and relevant core mathematical concepts and computational techniques to solve complex problems. You’ll also learn how to identify opportunities for and conduct research projects in physics – perhaps opening a window on an area of interest for your future career.","PROFESSIONS: Consultant.

Fundamentally interdisciplinary, geography is one of the few disciplines that encompasses very different ways of knowing, including the natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Geographers investigate the character of places, the distribution of phenomena across space, biophysical processes and features, and dynamic relationships between humans and environments. Geographers are, therefore, uniquely equipped to understand and address critical problems facing the world.
This major will give you advanced knowledge and understanding of the social and biophysical processes that shape Australian and other environments. You’ll evaluate data and knowledge from environmental and social sciences, including Indigenous perspectives, to develop geographical ways of understanding contemporary environmental issues. You’ll analyse and synthesise complex environmental, economic, social and political information to enable a geographical understanding of humans, environments and the dynamic relationships between them. You’ll develop critical analysis skills as you apply theories and concepts to case studies, including from the perspective of environmental justice.","PROFESSIONS: Climate change assessment and planner.

Fundamentally interdisciplinary, geography is one of the few disciplines that encompasses very different ways of knowing, including the natural and social sciences, and the humanities. Geographers investigate the character of places, the distribution of phenomena across space, biophysical processes and features, and dynamic relationships between humans and environments. Geographers are, therefore, uniquely equipped to understand and address critical problems facing the world.
This major will give you advanced knowledge and understanding of the social and biophysical processes that shape Australian and other environments. You’ll evaluate data and knowledge from environmental and social sciences, including Indigenous perspectives, to develop geographical ways of understanding contemporary environmental issues. You’ll analyse and synthesise complex environmental, economic, social and political information to enable a geographical understanding of humans, environments and the dynamic relationships between them. You’ll develop critical analysis skills as you apply theories and concepts to case studies, including from the perspective of environmental justice.","PROFESSIONS: Climate change assessment and planner.
