You’ll study some of society’s most  intriguing issues along with the techniques to analyse them and devise  break-through solutions. You’ll be equipped to combine your hard knowledge of  world issues with advanced data analysis techniques. You’ll develop the  knowledge to select the appropriate tools and methodologies for the issues  you’re working on, along with the communication skills to collate and present  your findings to decision-makers, to enable evidence-based solutions that can  positively transform society. Climate change is an example of a contemporary  challenge that can’t be solved by 'pure' science alone. Solutions will come  from people who can not only interpret the data but also understand the need  for social impact studies, policy development, and effective public  communication. Social scientists work in these intersecting spaces, which is  why they are in high-demand across government departments, creative industries,  political parties, the business sector, in think tanks and non-government  organisations (NGOs). You don’t need prior knowledge of statistical  research methods as you’ll study core courses that will develop your skills in  analysing social policy and data, along with your two majors. Each of the  majors represents a different perspective on the challenges of the future and  allow you to develop areas of expertise that can open doors to a broad  range of careers. There are also opportunities to undertake an internship in an  area of your interest, and join a global study tour. You can choose two of the following majors: Economics: If you want an expert insight into why the  Australian dollar fluctuates or what caused the Global Financial Crisis, this  major is the ideal choice. You’ll gain an understanding of the big financial  issues facing societies and learn how governments make decisions about what to  spend on complex issues such as the environment, healthcare, infrastructure and  resources. You’ll also learn how markets work, and how businesses make  decisions about pricing, staffing and responding to competition. Environmental Sustainability: Environmental sustainability is the world’s  biggest issue. This major is not about the ‘hard science’ of the environment,  but instead explores the key social and policy issues behind the need for  sustainable management of our planet’s finite resources. In this major you’ll  study environmental politics, climate change policy, the economics of natural  resources, and environmental ethics and culture. Global Security Threats: If you’re interested in developing  future-focused solutions to some of the world’s most complex challenges, this  major is for you. You’ll be exposed to a stimulating array of international  issues, including conflict and forced displacement, terrorism and political  violence, Islam-West relations, cybercrime, energy security, and the  environment. You'll gain a critical understanding of underlying causes, underpinned by a foundational course in World History. Media, Communication and Social Change: In the information age, the ways we  communicate - and are communicated to - are diverse and ever changing. The ability  to understand and manipulate communications is crucial to creating change. Producing, interpreting and analysing communications are not only  desirable skills, but fascinating areas of study. This major covers such topics as, the power of mass and social media, journalism, public  relations, discourse analysis, new communication technologies, political spin, and the global spread of English. Politics in Asia: This major harnesses Griffith’s  internationally recognised strengths in politics and Asian studies. You’ll  develop a deep understanding of the political, cultural, economic and social  dimensions of the Asian region.  Topics include the rise of China, global security, the interconnection of  business and politics, the role of international organisations, and Australia’s  place in the region. Social Justice: This major is for those who are motivated by the fundamental question, ‘What makes a fair society?’ and are passionate about  fighting for a better world. Social justice refers to the idea that all people  deserve equal and fair opportunities and treatment. By specialising in this  area, you’ll explore contemporary hot topics such as human rights, indigenous history  and disadvantage, gender and crime, domestic violence,  youth justice, power and politics and the administration of the law.","Economics: You will be prepared for work in government,  NGOs, the finance sector or large business organisations. You’ll be equipped to  take on roles analysing and interpreting the interaction between markets, the  environment, the health sector, transport, financial policy developments and  decision-making, and the impact of global conditions on the national economy. Environmental Sustainability: You will be prepared for work in  environmental science communication, environmental management and planning,  policy development, environmental sustainability advocacy (in agriculture,  industry, and natural resources), social and economic environmental impact  analysis, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Global Security Threats: You will be prepared for work as an analyst,  community advocate, liaison or leader, policy developer (in analysis and  evaluation), research officer, corporate strategy officer, or risk adviser. Media, Communication and Social Change: You will be prepared for work as a  communications officer, social policy researcher, speech writer, media liaison,  public relations consultant, social media analyst or other roles where you’re  required to analyse, evaluate and interpret communication strategies or writing  across diverse genres and on various platforms. Politics in Asia: You will be prepared for roles that provide  advice to government, business leaders and NGOs in areas such as Asian economic, environment and social  policy, regional relationships, regional development, Asian political  structures, East-Asian political economy and trade relations.
