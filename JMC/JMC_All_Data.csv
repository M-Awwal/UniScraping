This depends on where you would like to focus your career. Would you like to be a performer, or be behind the desk? In our music + songwriting courses there are units on how to produce your own music which might be worth considering. If you want to know all there is about audio — including how to produce all kinds of music and sound, then this is the course for you. Being a musician is an added bonus for this course as the knowledge and skills you have as a musician can be applied to production. Having said that, you don’t need to be a musician to study this course, as basic music theory is included in the curriculum.
Are JMC courses available to study online?
No, our courses are hands on and practical. Students are required to attend classes to receive ongoing mentorship, learn new skills and work with the equipment provided. We do encourage our students to use online study resources, however our courses would not be as immersive as they are without the practical component.
Do I need to provide samples of my work to support my application to the Audio Engineering & Sound Production?

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!
  What software programs will I use in the Contemporary Music & Performance course?

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!
  What software programs will I use in the Contemporary Music & Performance course?

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!
  What software programs will I use in the Contemporary Music & Performance course?

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!
  What software programs will I use in the Contemporary Music & Performance course?

If you are a vocalist, you are not required to play an instrument. However, if you have selected to play an instrument other than voice as part of your studies, your eligibility will be determined during the audition process. All successful applicants will be provided the tuition you need to progress through the course.
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and performing in front of a live audience is not your thing, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance (unless you choose to!).
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point. Additional support throuhgout your course will be available. 
What do I need for my Contemporary Music & Performance audition and how can I ensure it's a success?
This depends on what you’re auditioning with – there are different requirements for vocals vs instruments for example, so check with your admissions advisor as to what you will need to bring to your audition.
To make the best of the audition - practice! Play something that you’re comfortable with and know well. Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Don’t base your audition song on what you think we want to hear – we want to see who you are as an artist, so choose a song that you love playing and that shows your own unique style. Make sure you’ve brought everything you need. Don’t stress. We want you to do well and will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible.
My singing voice needs work, can I still apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course?
Definitely. As part of the application process we conduct auditions which will help determine your level. Vocal ability is subjective and everyone is their own worst critic, so we encourage you to come along and show us what you’ve got...keeping in mind that we don’t expect you to be an accomplished performer or finished artist. It's our job however to get you there!

Write a small paragraph explaining your choices and rationale behind it. Show us your rigor and initiative. Give us an insight into your creative approach, your creativity and the resulting output.
2. Tell us your thoughts
Choose a brand that you like and think is successful; write a short paragraph reflecting on why you like it and the reasons behind its success.
Choose a brand that you dislike or has not been doing well; write a short paragraph reflecting on what the issues are and how they might improve.
Show us the way you see the world around you, your standard of what makes a design good or bad and an insight into your thought process.
Do I need to learn coding to be eligible for the Visual Communication course?
No. We equip you with digital tools that allow you to create high-functioning prototypes without coding. 
How will I connect with the industry while studying the Visual Communication course?
We are committed to strengthening our Design Industry connections by fostering both internships and industry based projects. You will also be mentored by industry practitioners on some of the projects throughout your course of study. In addition, we have industry guests come and talk on a range of topics in each trimester, so you get to build your network even before you graduate.
How much theory VS practice is there in the Visual Communication course?
This course is very hands on and you will tackle real world creative projects. However, having a foundational understanding of design theory is still vitally important. There is approximately a 25% (theory) to 75% (practice) balance.
Are there exams in the Visual Communication course?
No. We assess your work as would happen in the workplace via proposal documents and reports, presentations and demonstrations.
Do I need to be able to draw to be eligible for the Visual Communication course?
As with any design you will need to communicate ideas via drawing and sketching. We believe anyone can learn how to think visually, and we teach sketching techniques right from the beginning.

Do I need a portfolio of work to apply for the Visual Communication course?
At application, we are most keen to learn about your passion and reasons for wanting to study design. In addition to that, we ask that you answer the following two questions prior to coming in for the interview:
1. Show us your best piece of work
What’s something you’ve created that you’re really proud of? It can be any of the following:
An image (a photography piece, an illustration or a painting)
A project (an idea, a story, a film critique, a blog, etc…)
A product (a website, an animation, a poster, presentation, etc…)
Write a small paragraph explaining your choices and rationale behind it. Show us your rigor and initiative. Give us an insight into your creative approach, your creativity and the resulting output.
2. Tell us your thoughts
Choose a brand that you like and think is successful; write a short paragraph reflecting on why you like it and the reasons behind its success.
Choose a brand that you dislike or has not been doing well; write a short paragraph reflecting on what the issues are and how they might improve.
Show us the way you see the world around you, your standard of what makes a design good or bad and an insight into your thought process.
Do I need to learn coding to be eligible for the Visual Communication course?
No. We equip you with digital tools that allow you to create high-functioning prototypes without coding. 
How will I connect with the industry while studying the Visual Communication course?
We are committed to strengthening our Design Industry connections by fostering both internships and industry based projects. You will also be mentored by industry practitioners on some of the projects throughout your course of study. In addition, we have industry guests come and talk on a range of topics in each trimester, so you get to build your network even before you graduate.
How much theory VS practice is there in the Visual Communication course?
This course is very hands on and you will tackle real world creative projects. However, having a foundational understanding of design theory is still vitally important. There is approximately a 25% (theory) to 75% (practice) balance.
Are there exams in the Visual Communication course?
No. We assess your work as would happen in the workplace via proposal documents and reports, presentations and demonstrations.
Do I need to be able to draw to be eligible for the Visual Communication course?
As with any design you will need to communicate ideas via drawing and sketching. We believe anyone can learn how to think visually, and we teach sketching techniques right from the beginning. So, if you are open to making marks and learning how to do it well, that’s all you need to start! | ",Design Fundamentals,,"This unit explores the foundations of good visual design.

This course is very hands on and you will tackle real world creative projects. However, having a foundational understanding of design theory is still vitally important. There is approximately a 25% (theory) to 75% (practice) balance.
Are there exams in the Visual Communication course?
No. We assess your work as would happen in the workplace via proposal documents and reports, presentations and demonstrations.
Do I need to be able to draw to be eligible for the Visual Communication course?
As with any design you will need to communicate ideas via drawing and sketching. We believe anyone can learn how to think visually, and we teach sketching techniques right from the beginning.

Yes, while the content covers a range of arts management areas, there is a large focus on events, touring and festivals. In fact, the wide range of operational, business and marketing skills you are taught can be applied to a wide range of careers and the running of any business but would be particularly useful for event management. 
How will the Entertainment Business Management course differ from a university business degree?
Our degree offers many similar units of study, however it is focused specifically on the entertainment and creative industries, as opposed to a university business degree which would cover business management skills across all industries.

Yes, while the content covers a range of arts management areas, there is a large focus on events, touring and festivals.

Yes, while the content covers a range of arts management areas, there is a large focus on events, touring and festivals. In fact, the wide range of operational, business and marketing skills you are taught can be applied to a wide range of careers and the running of any business but would be particularly useful for event management.

Our degree offers many similar units of study, however it is focused specifically on the entertainment and creative industries, as opposed to a university business degree which would cover business management skills across all industries.

 ",Australia,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,"I have no experience in making games (although I have played many). Will I be able to do well in the Game Design course?
It’s your compulsion to create, tell stories and discover new forms of play that we’re really looking for, and we teach the course from beginner level up so you’re in good hands.
Is the Game Design course more focused on design or development?
The Game course is primarily focused on art and design, but we recognise that a familiarity with scripting and programming is a key part of the skillset of a game artist, and you will certainly learn skills in those areas as well.
The emphasis is on understanding the theory behind games, designing interesting challenges, mechanics, concepts and stories, and creating the art and assets for those concepts. You would be studying a mix of art and design, software and programming skills, and theoretical concepts.
Are there any work experience/internship opportunities specific to the Game Design course?
While the availability of internships and work placements depends on the individual companies and studios in the industry, we have strong relationships with many practising game designers and game studios. As a result of these connections there is the potential for you to experience internships and placements, studio visits, talks and workshops by industry practitioners, and assessment feedback opportunities from industry people during dedicated 'speed networking' nights. Where practical, interviews will be arranged for individual graduating students with companies seeking to recruit new talent.

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you’re booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | ",Music History I,,"This unit provides an overview of Western

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you’re booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | ",Music History I,,"This unit provides an overview of Western

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you’re booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | ",Music History I,,"This unit provides an overview of Western

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you’re booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point.  
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | ",Music History I,,"This unit provides an overview of Western

This depends on what outcome you want to work towards, what career you want to ultimately pursue and where your passion lies. If you see yourself performing your music to a live audience and are excited about the thought of doing so then contermporary music performance might be the way to go. Bear in mind that the Bachelor Degree in Contemporary Music Performance does teach two units in Songwriting.

If you love the idea of composing, creating, and telling stories through your music and you're not comfortable with the thought of performing in front of an audience then the song writing course may be a better option for you. 

Of course, if you decide to study the songwriting course, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to perform on your own or within an ensemble.
Do I still need to audition for Songwriting?
An audition is not a requirement of entry. What we do need to see, is a demonstrated passion and/or experience in songwriting. This may involve an audition, or simply being able to show samples of composition work (lyrics, chord charts, or past recordings). Our staff will let you know if you need to prepare anything when you’re booking an interview. 
Do I need to know music theory to be eligible for the Songwriting course?
No. For those with little or no theory background, we'll teach you what you need to know from the ground up. We also offer a program during orientation week which provides a crash course to help you get started if theory isn’t your strong point.  
I’m not sure whether to apply for the Contemporary Music & Performance course or Songwriting course. How do I choose the best one for me?
This depends where your passion lies. Do you love performing and getting on stage in front of an audience, or do you prefer composing, creating, and telling stories through music? If you get stage fright and the thought of performing in front of a live audience makes you feel weak at the knees, then the songwriting course could be a better option for you. As a songwriter, you’ll still have the opportunity to participate in an ensemble, in order to learn how to develop your musical ideas to be performance ready, but you won’t have to have the spotlight on your own performance. | ",Music History I,,"This unit provides an overview of Western
