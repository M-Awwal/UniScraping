Students will generate project options that draw on historical and contemporary research issues and approaches to guide the development of their own research questions and methods specific to their object of research. A range of methodological approaches will be explored, including practice-based methods, industry observation/shadowing, qualitative interviews, and quantitative digital methods. Students will develop their own reading lists, identify appropriate research methods and conduct some pilot testing and evaluation of findings for their project. Students will also learn how to read and consume academic and scholarly research in order to critique problematic issues in published research reports.",Visual Storytelling,,"Visual storytelling is increasingly being used in a variety of contexts including websites, magazines, advertising, business and public affairs, exhibitions and events and television, often working across a number of platforms at the same time as requiring responsive design approaches for a diversity of viewing experiences. With access to increasing amounts and types of data, professional communicators need to be able to extract meaning to connect with a variety of different audiences in creative, dynamic, and emotional ways. This Unit introduces students to story archetypes, structure and flow. It encourages metaphorical and anagogical storytelling using appropriation making reference to genre and research. This practical unit explores a range of traditional hands-on techniques and digital software commonly used across the communications sector.  Students are encouraged to explore and develop their own mark and image making skills aimed at specific target audiences and communication contexts.",Foundations of Media Arts and Production,,"This unit explores creative and independent media arts practices across moving image, audio and participatory forms, and introduces students to fundamental principles of sound and screen production. The unit maps theoretical and practical connections between the creation and study of images and sound across media formats through an integrated theory/practice programme focused on the processes through which media artefacts are created. Students learn how to analyse and critically evaluate screen media and also to plan and make simple short works of their own. It introduces students to relevant media arts histories and contexts (with a focus on cinema) in addition to a range of technologies, media practices and production techniques.",Writing Ecologies,,"This unit introduces students to a set of theories and strategies for exploring storytelling in networked environments and the way social and cultural experiences continue to shape and inform the way we read, write and communicate. Grounded in contexts key to Communication Arts practice, the unit explores what it means to be digitally literate, the difference between newer and older storytelling environments, and the way networked technologies have re-shaped contemporary reading/writing practices. Students will complete a range of analytical and creative tasks that aim to build understanding of the dynamic nature of communication while further developing academic research and writing skills.",Advertising: An Introduction,,"In this unit students gain a grounding in the key areas of advertising and the steps in the advertising process, viz. research, strategy, creative (copywriting & art direction), production, account service, media planning and marketing communication.  Students are also introduced to the issues surrounding advertising and its role in society.","Data, Mediation, Power",,"Data, Mediation, Power investigates the operation of power in contemporary digital media cultures and economy. The unit examines the primary role played by data in determining how we live in the world. This includes how we interact with the world, its people and digital artefacts, in terms of communication and meaning. The unit focuses on technologies of control and governance related to algorithmic architectures and data economies. Who benefits from data and mediation and what are the limits and possibilities of data? Ultimately, this kind of critical analysis invites us to think about what constitutes a just, democratic society and what constitutes an ethical media life.",Public Relations Theory and Practice,,"This unit introduces the student to the theory and research that serves as the foundation of the practice of public relations. The unit surveys the history of the discipline, the theories on which the discipline is based, and current models of practice. The unit focuses on understanding how to research and analyse the opinions of organisational publics in order to develop mutually beneficial relationships with those publics. The contemporary practice of public relations requires an understanding of a broad range of social science theory and research and the ability to incorporate that knowledge in the solution of public relations problems.",Media Memory,,"Media memory is now a critical field of study in journalism, advertising, visual communication and media. The media builds local, national and transnational identities through the representation of the past. Media industries such as advertising rely upon collective memories to design campaigns in order to reach particular audiences. Journalists increasingly 'assemble' stories from digital archives, recombining similar or related events from the past to build stories and features of the present. Individuals increasingly contribute to news events through their own 'witnessing' of events, capturing and sharing material using mobile and social media. This unit addresses these processes by providing a brief history and overview of approaches to thinking about media and memory, in the context of the significance of media convergence and digital memory within contemporary media ecologies. The unit provides students with a series of case studies that approach the memory of particular events, drawing on examples from advertising, public relations, visual communication, animation, film, broadcasting and journalism. Students develop a media
research project that engages with the material presented in the unit.",Professional Writing and Editing,,"Professional communicators require advanced writing and editing skills. This unit explores the nature of writing and preparation of texts for use across different media platforms and in various contexts. In particular, the unit develops skills in editing and re-purposing of writing, and further develops understanding of key writing tools such as voice, emphasis, tone, grammar and punctuation and Plain English for professional purposes. Through in-class workshops and time-restricted editing tasks, students will demonstrate a range of professional writing skills from corporate communications to advanced editing. Through in class presentations, discussions and short written tasks, students will demonstrate an applied understanding of conceptual and theoretical issues related to writing and editing for diverse audiences and applied to a range of current issues.",Media Cultures and Industries,,"This unit introduces students to the concept of media in terms of how it has changed, how it works and its impact on our lives and society. It builds the necessary foundation for further theoretical and practical study and understanding of the media in future years. Its approach brings practice-based research together with experiential learning and theoretical reflection. At the conclusion of this unit students will be able to demonstrate a fundamental critical understanding of the media. In addition, students will have developed their digital literacy through the creation of digital creative works.",Introduction to Journalism,,"This unit introduces students to the fields of journalism and new media, covering the concepts of news values and news research for target audiences. It looks at the role of the journalist and the professional skills of news gathering and news writing.   The subject also considers the legal and ethical obstacles and obligations faced by journalists operating in an environment of fast paced communication. The methodologies underlying professional practice as well as  delivering news with speed for multimedia platforms are central to this unit.",Media Law and Ethics,,"Media Law and Ethics focuses on the media and communication industries of public relations, journalism, advertising and media production, and examines issues including: the legal framework in which these creative communication industries operate, the role of ethics in decision-making in these industries, and the impact of regulation. It considers these issues in relation to their historical and philosophical contexts, and in terms of the contemporary context of digital networked media.

Students explore and classify biodiversity and how organisms function, acquire and assimilate resources and co-ordinate growth and reproduction. Organisms interact with one another and their environment forming a complex set of interactions in ecosystems. It is these interactions that have driven evolution. Ultimately human survival depends on the sustainable use of this biodiversity and ecosystems.",Biological Adaptation to Climate Change,,"This unit investigates how organisms respond to variation in climate and what can be done to reduce their vulnerability to anthropogenic climate change. The unit makes use of a novel conceptual framework that defines âvulnerabilityâ as a function of the âexposureâ and âsensitivityâ of organisms to climate change. Therefore, we will begin by exploring how organisms are exposed to climate change, from regional climatic changes acting at the scale of populations, to local climatological effects acting at the scale of individuals. Next, we will examine what determines the sensitivity of organisms, focusing on the physiological, behavioural, and life-history traits that affect the ability of organisms to cope with and adapt to climate change. Then, we will show how exposure and sensitivity combine to determine the vulnerability of organisms, including in both managed and natural ecosystems. Finally, we will discuss the âmitigationâ and âadaptationâ strategies that can prevent the worst of the potential impacts from becoming realised and help protect our biodiversity in the face of anthropogenic climate change.",Functional Proteins and Genes,,"Biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of life.

The unit involves reflecting on the links between mental health workforce training and the academic discipline of psychology. The focus of this unit is on the knowledge required for mental health workers.",Social Psychology,,"Social psychology is the study of human behaviour and mental processes in their social context. Social psychology examines social behaviour and social thinking using scientific psychological research methods. This unit considers both classic and recent theories, research and applications in core areas of social psychology such as: attitudes, stereotyping and prejudice, social cognition, group processes, cross-cultural and indigenous psychology, and social influence. Emphasis is placed upon the role of contemporary research and theory in increasing our understanding of social phenomena and the relevance of this to everyday life.",Advanced Topics in Psychology,,"In this unit students develop an advanced level of theoretical and empirical knowledge in selected core topics of psychology, an awareness of how this knowledge underpins evidence-based approaches to psychological intervention, and an enhanced capacity for conducting research in selected topic areas. The unit fosters an appreciation of psychology as a scientific discipline, and of how sound research provides the foundation for solving problems of human mental processes and behaviour. Skills in the critical evaluation of knowledge and research are developed.","Psychology, Crime and Law",,"This unit covers a broad spectrum of issues relevant to legal and forensic psychology. How accurate is a witnessâs memory? How good are we at identifying a suspect in a line-up? Why do people confess to crimes they never committed? What are good interviewing and interrogation techniques for understanding the truth? How accurate are repressed memories, and how are false memories implanted?",Psychology: Behavioural Science,,"Psychology is a field of scientific inquiry that uses a set of scientific techniques and methods to explain and understand the causes of behaviour.  This unit introduces students to the discipline of psychology through a focus on physiological basis of behaviour, memory, language and thought, sensation and perception, motivation, emotion, learning, and the research methods used to scientifically study behaviour. In this general introductory topic students explore how psychology, as a profession, applies its knowledge to practical problems in human behaviour and provides a foundation for more advanced units for students continuing to further studies.",Psychology and the Online World,,"The world has seen an enormous explosion of activity that takes place in online environments that include the Internet, intranets, gaming platforms and peer to peer phone communication (e.g. SMS). There are wide ranging debates about the use and effects of online communication with concerns about hacking, trolling, bullying, scamming, online addiction appearing on a daily basis. Others celebrate the potential of the Internet to produce profound social change. Is the online world quite as bad or as good as it is made out to be? What are the psychological processes behind these and other online behaviours? Why not find out?",Counselling and Consultation,,"This unit introduces students to the basic skills underlying professional helping, providing a foundation for further training in counselling or psychological therapy. Students explore the professional helping relationship, the counselling process, common counselling and therapeutic frameworks, and learn key counselling micro-skills. There is a strong focus on applied skill development through in-class skills practice and assessment. The unit provides structured opportunities to reflect on personal and professional development and readiness for further training in professional helping.",Cognitive Processes,,"Cognitive Processes is the study of the mental processes that underpin attention, perception, decision-making, language, and memory. Conceptual and research questions include: What are the structures and mechanisms of human memory? What processes underpin acquisition of language, and are the processes similar when we learn a second language? What factors affect attention? How do some people become expert problem solvers? Why do humans make irrational decisions? Contemporary theories will be discussed and evaluated. Investigative research methods including experiments, computer modelling, clinical case studies, and brain imaging are evaluated.",Psychology: Human Behaviour,,"Psychology is a field of scientific inquiry that uses a set of scientific techniques and methods to explain and understand the causes of behaviour.  As a profession, psychology applies its knowledge to practical problems in human behaviour. This unit covers a range of topics in psychology at an introductory level including: the history of psychology, intelligence, social psychology, developmental psychology, indigenous and cultural psychology, personality, and abnormal psychology.",Developmental Psychology,,"Structured around an overview of lifespan development including diversity, this unit explores the holistic nature of growth and development through developmental theory and research. This unit highlights the interactive nature of three main areas of development: biological, cognitive, and psychosocial changes that affect the individual from conception to end of life. The unit encourages observation as a means for understanding development and promoting individuals wellbeing. An understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development will be integrated into the unit alongside an appreciation of richness in diversity within various cultural contexts.",Introduction to Logical Thinking,,"This unit introduces psychology students to the basic aspects of reasoning and argument, with particular emphasis on psychological and scientific thinking.  It aims to help students develop the skills needed to understand and evaluate psychological research and the processes of scientific reasoning, and to present their own ideas and arguments effectively. Topics covered include: barriers to critical thinking; nonrational forms of persuasion; the structure of arguments; the concepts of knowledge, belief, truth, validity, soundness, values; linguistics sources of confusion; evaluating arguments; formal and informal fallacies in reasoning; deduction and induction in science; arguments related to enduring debates and worldviews in psychology.",Advanced Research Methods,,"This unit advances upon the research methods and statistics taught in the prerequisite unit, Experimental Design and Analysis. It introduces students to nonexperimental, correlational research design, and develops skills in survey research, including questionnaire design and administration, and survey sampling. Knowledge and skills in the construction and evaluation of psychological tests are also taught. Accompanying correlational statistical techniques are taught, together with advanced analysis of variance, and instruction in the use of SPSS. The unit also develops skills in conducting and reporting psychological research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
