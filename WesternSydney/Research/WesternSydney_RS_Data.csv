The unit will involve measuring various types of potential hazards and comparing the results to current standards before recommending methods of controlling the hazard/s.",Methods of Researching,,"From 2015 students should take 401080 - Research Protocol Design and Practice. In this unit postgraduate students develop a proposal for a research study in an area of interest, drawing upon their knowledge and experiences from other units in their program of study. Students learn how to apply research methods to a variety of research situations and questions; to understand how research questions are developed and answered empirically through suitable choice of research methodology, design and method; and how research findings are validated and communicated. The unit is taught through self-paced, self-directed learning. Class contact is three days of workshops, in the first and second half of the session.",Science and Health Research Project PG,,This unit develops critical and analytical skills by undertaking and completing a research project in an area of relevance. The project is carried out on an individual basis.

This unit is designed to develop students' knowledge of the principles and processes necessary for evidence-based clinical practice. General concepts associated with evidence-based nursing are explored. In addition students are assisted to formulate focussed clinical questions and conduct a comprehensive literature search for research evidence that may assist in answering such questions. Issues and techniques involved in the rigorous appraisal of research reports are addressed. The importance of clinical significance and individual patient preferences when making clinical judgments about the implementation of research findings are also explored.",Health Economics and Comparative Health Systems,,"The unit explores contemporary examples of the role of economics in the organisation, funding and provision of health services. Case examples include, Australia, America, China, Hong Kong, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and India.  Students use the principles of economics to assess funding of health with a focus on the interface between economics, ethics and equity in decision making. They also consider the tendency for health systems to be organised around economic principles in areas such as, contracting out, health insurance and pharmaceuticals.  Students are encouraged to reflect on the challenges and future directions of their own health system in the context of the unit components.",Professional Topic,,"This unit is designed to allow high achieving students to comprehensively explore a relevant topic of interest to them, either through a minor supervised research project or industry-based project.  This unitâs flexible delivery offers a unique experience specific to each project and student.  Students in this unit will develop extensive skills through project-based learning essential for employment and/or higher degree studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
