The Bachelor of Arts degree enriches your understanding of how human beings make, and debate life’s meaning and values. Students develop their capacity for critical analysis and argument as well as an awareness of the value of language as a political, intellectual, creative and communicative tool.
The diverse range of courses and electives form pathways for majors in:
Business
The study of business explores key management skills and gives a sophisticated knowledge of strategy, leadership and other managerial concepts through the study of economics, accounting, management and human resources.
English and Media Studies
How does language persuade and move us? How does culture respond to or imagine war? Students complete their studies in English with a sophisticated knowledge of both the world’s literary heritage and their own contemporary culture, from the classical heroic epics to contemporary social media.
Geography
Geography is the study of both the physical and human environments in which we live and the interactions between people and nature. Geography provides a bridge between the social and natural sciences and gives students the techniques to analyse our environment and society, including using Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing.
History
History seeks to understand individual and group behaviour and to explain the forces that have shaped human civilisation: social change, wars, revolutions and popular movements. Historical analysis examines the relationships between past events and the present. The student of history learns how to assimilate and weigh evidence, analyse problems and balance different points of view in the context of the past and of the present.
Indonesian Studies
Indonesia is one of Australia’s most important neighbouring countries. Indonesian Studies gives you the ability to read, write, speak and understand standard Indonesian, and will also give you a broad understanding of Indonesian society and culture. No prior Indonesian knowledge is required.
International and Political Studies (IPS)
IPS involves the study of power and norms in a rapidly changing global environment. It covers the major factors, ideas and key issues of domestic, regional and global politics, international relations and ethical thought, all of which have a profound impact on Australia’s national security and its place in the world.
Key features:
– You have a choice of majors within a BA degree.
– UNSW Canberra’s Academy Library Special Collections are of national significance, including over 300 manuscript collections, 13,000 rare items and the papers of former Prime Minister John Howard.

  This program is built on solid computer science and mathematics fundamentals with a focus on both theoretical foundations and practical approaches to computation and its applications within security. In this program, students first apply these techniques to gaming and then later learn more about hardware, systems, networking and the Internet, and learn to secure such environments.
  The design methods, tools and programming ability gained can be applied to many kinds of computer applications. In a final-year capstone team project students will be able to select from a wide range of ADF and civilian application domains in which to develop these abilities in computing and cyber security.
Students will use state of the art equipment in all their security and forensics courses in a Cyber Range.
Pass-level students in Computing and Cyber Security should complete their programs within three years. Eligible and approved Honours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets can continue with their programs at the end of the third year. Army officer cadets, however, at the end of their third year transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon.

Honours is a means for connecting undergraduate study with supervised independent research by consolidating and extending work completed in the undergraduate program. As part of the honours program students will be expected to complete a significant independent research project and may be expected to complete coursework. In addition to conducting research and coursework students will generally also be expected to undertake Occupational Health & Safety (OH&S) training, attend and present seminars, write a literature review, and write a thesis.
Honours students who are RAN midshipmen or RAAF officer cadets continue with this program at UNSW Canberra at ADFA after completion of their three year BSc program and then complete their Honours program at the end of the fourth year. Army officer cadets, however, at the end of the third year BSc program transfer to the Royal Military College, Duntroon for a year of military training to be commissioned as lieutenants. Those who qualify to undertake their Honours program return to the Academy to complete their program for a year.

Militarism glorifies war. Pacifism condemns it absolutely. Just War Theory treats war as an evil, but one that is sometimes necessary and morally defensible. So when is a state justified in resorting to military force? Traditionally, Just War theorists have maintained that only national self-defence against aggression constitutes a just cause. More recently this view has come under critical pressure. Some contemporary Just War thinkers see the traditional view as too permissive insofar as it licences the use of force - and the death and destruction attendant thereupon - in response to any breach of political sovereignty or territorial integrity. Others see the traditional paradigm as too restrictive insofar as it forbids both armed humanitarian intervention (the use of force to defend foreign nationals against a murderous or oppressive government), and preventive action to neutralise a threat in advance of its materialization (to eliminate WMDs, for instance). This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the philosophical debate over when the use of military force is morally justified.

This course introduces a conflict transformation approach to conflict and post conflict analysis. Beginning with a critical survey of the field, the course explores different approaches through consideration of protracted conflicts in contemporary global politics. Conflict transformation theory recognises the complexity of conflict dynamics (not having neat beginnings, middles and endings) and challenges the effectiveness of management and resolution approaches. A transformational approach observes that peace settlement and management strategies themselves have often been the source of deep resentment and justification for further violence. Transformation of protracted conflicts require more than the redistribution of material resources or reframing of positions into resolved outcomes. The approach builds upon a deeper analysis of identity of stakeholders, issues, historical grievances, structural factors and divergent world views. In policy terms, this approach strongly aligns with the UN Peacebuilding Commission approach.

This course provides a detailed critical survey of key issues, theories and practices of global security in the early 21st Century. It examines the contested and changing nature of the concept of security, and surveys theoretical debates from the traditional to the cutting edge of current thinking. This course goes beyond questions of national security to take a specifically global perspective. It is especially concerned with understanding the intersection of global insecurity dynamics and global governance regimes, across a range of issue areas.

Militarism glorifies war. Pacifism condemns it absolutely. Just War Theory treats war as an evil, but one that is sometimes necessary and morally defensible. So when is a state justified in resorting to military force? Traditionally, Just War theorists have maintained that only national self-defence against aggression constitutes a just cause. More recently this view has come under critical pressure. Some contemporary Just War thinkers see the traditional view as too permissive insofar as it licences the use of force - and the death and destruction attendant thereupon - in response to any breach of political sovereignty or territorial integrity. Others see the traditional paradigm as too restrictive insofar as it forbids both armed humanitarian intervention (the use of force to defend foreign nationals against a murderous or oppressive government), and preventive action to neutralise a threat in advance of its materialization (to eliminate WMDs, for instance). This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of the philosophical debate over when the use of military force is morally justified.

This course is about the power of words, stories and images to inform, persuade, unite and divide. Studying a range of theories and a small number of case studies, we ask: What is the potential for narratives to serve as rallying points for social groups? How do these groups adapt these narratives and the institutions which maintain them according to changing needs and concerns? What constitutes offence on the page, and how might communication be strategically suppressed as a result? How are old and new communication technologies put to use in the battle of narratives? Materials studied may include political treatises, propaganda posters, novels, documentaries, feature films, anthologies of soldiers’ writings, and various forms of Social Media.

The aim of this course is to give you an insight into Logistics and Global Supply Chain Management. Many students come to this subject with their own (mis)interpretations of what is meant by logistics and supply chain management. By the end of the module, you should be clear what is meant by these terms and how they differ from each other. While the discussion on the linguistic origins of logistics might appear superficial, it is nonetheless important as it highlights the military roots of logistics.

A common distinction that is made between special operations forces (SOF) and their conventional counterparts is that SOF are 'strategic' troops. But is this really so? And if so, what does it mean? This course explores the strategic utility of special operations and the forces that carry them out, and explores competing and complementary theories of special operations. Strategic theories addressed in the course focus particularly on approaches that emphasise the notion of introducing 'strategic paralysis', often most closely associated with air-power theorists like Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell. These are contrasted with attrition based strategies of special operations such as that proposed by James Kiras. Influential 'kinetic' theories of special operations, like that developed by William McRaven, are compared and contrasted with strategies of influence which emphasise the 'indirect approach' of special operations forces engaged in unconventional warfare.

The foremost expectation is effective leadership, particularly in the development and delivery of public policy. Public leadership transcending organisational management is expected within communities concerned with practical outcomes; agencies committed to regional issues; and, institutions with oversight of national priorities. Despite the substantial premium placed on public leadership, few theorists and even fewer practitioners have closely examined the challenges of exercising public leadership in a range of contexts or the relationship between public leadership and policy formulation. The Master of Public Leadership and Policy uniquely addresses this gap by offering students a combination of courses focused specifically on public leadership alongside a rich selection of electives addressing broader issues related to local, national and global policy and its implementation.

This course provides students with an opportunity to develop an understanding of the processes and practices associated with the requirements engineering and business analysis disciplines.
The course also introduces tools commonly used in requirements practice and details how business analysis and requirements engineering coexist with other disciplines (particularly systems engineering and project management).
The complete and accurate definition of system requirements is a primary focus of the early systems engineering effort. The life cycle of a system begins with a mission statement, which is translated into a large number of statements of requirement that form the basis for the logical (functional) design and subsequently the physical architecture. These transitions must be managed by a rigorous process that guarantees that all relevant requirements are included (and all irrelevant requirements excluded). The establishment of correct requirements is fundamental to the success of projects.
Once requirements have been collected, requirements practice then focuses on the management of these requirements from the system level right down to the lowest constituent component. This process involves elicitation, analysis, definition and validation of system requirements.

Economic Geography is invaluable in providing the operational context for strategic managers and those responsible for implementing business strategy. The constitution of urban settings can be better understood through an attention to economic processes and practices, from regimes of production to international divisions of labour, the changing demographics of the workforce, flows of finance, services and products and the institutions of governance that regulate business practices. Economic Geography offers to students studying the Masters of Business a way of understanding evident geographical variation in economic practices, at the global scale but also from the point of view of the diverse practices observed in different locations. An understanding of the geographic landscape via the theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of Economic Geography lends specificity to the study of business practice. The course complements Strategic Management (ZBUS 8101) and Organisational Behaviour (ZBUS 8102) as core units in the Master of Business, as well as such electives as Cross-Cultural Management (ZBUS 8318) and Economic Worldview (ZBUS 8148).

Space Systems Engineering provides those studying the engineering of space systems with a grounding in the discipline of systems engineering, applying that body of knowledge to space systems by way of example throughout the course. The course begins by providing a framework within which to develop an understanding of the processes and management practises associated with the systems engineering discipline. The underlying systems engineering process is presented and is shown to be applied repeatedly throughout the entire system lifecycle.  Attention then focuses on the broad topic of systems engineering management and some of the activities normally associated with engineering management are detailed. The course also introduces tools commonly used in systems engineering and details how systems engineering coexists with other disciplines (particularly Project Management, Quality Management and Integrated Logistics Support Management). The systems engineering body of knowledge is reinforced by the use of example and tutorials throughout the course. Students are further practised though a series of individual exercises that reinforce the application of the discipline of systems engineering to the specific nature of space systems.
