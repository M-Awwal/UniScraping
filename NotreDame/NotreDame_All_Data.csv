Architecture enhances people’s lives through the creation of meaningful human environments. Many key challenges of contemporary society - such as sustainability, housing affordability, ageing-in-place, city living and community building - often involve spatial issues. Architecture applies a holistic way of thinking and acting to combine creative design processes and technical skills with understandings of human, cultural and environmental issues. Your first step on this journey is the Bachelor of Arts (Architecture) program.
Why study this degree
In the three-year Bachelor of Arts (Architecture) degree you will learn to design architectural projects, big and small, for residential and public spaces in urban, suburban and other contexts. You’ll research historic and contemporary architecture, make precise drawings and diagrams, and use physical and three-dimensional digital models while developing your creative and critical thinking.
Our program combines theory classes with practical studios. In the theory classes you will analyse the world in which we live. You’ll apply this knowledge and skills in studios as you design built environments and speculate about future possibilities for human occupation and ecological repair.
You will develop your sense of ethical, social and environmental responsibility as you learn to understand diverse cultures and contexts, and apply building technology and environmental science knowledge to solve increasingly complex design scenarios.
Our holistic approach to education, including classes in ethics and philosophy, and the opportunity to study a Minor in a discipline complementary to architecture, will extend your learning beyond the traditional architectural curriculum and prepare you for a dynamic professional life. Popular Minors that work well with Architecture are Archaeology, History, Environmental Management and Photography. See the full list of Minors under Program summary below. The freedom to choose a Minor from a complementary discipline allows you to follow your personal or professional interests and increases your graduate employability opportunities.
Through this program you will be well placed to make a life-long contribution to the intellectual, cultural and civic life of communities.
The Bachelor of Arts (Architecture) program can be a pathway to further study in the Master of Architecture program, and provides a strong foundation to develop the technical and communication skills, professional values and ethical practice required by architecture."," | School of Arts & Sciences, Fremantle Campus

Archaeology is a dynamic worldwide discipline that draws on both the sciences and the humanities to interpret the physical evidence left by humans and their ancestors around the planet. Practitioners use information from geography, history, mathematics, biology, anthropology, chemistry and sociology to process evidence at sites to form the best interpretation about past human behaviour.

Architecture enhances people’s lives through the creation of meaningful human environments. Many key challenges of contemporary society—such as sustainability, housing affordability, ageing-in-place, city living and community building—often involve spatial issues. Architecture applies a holistic way of thinking and acting to combine creative design processes and technical skills with understandings of human, cultural and environmental issues.
Notre Dame’s new Master of Architecture program provides a unique education, in the heart of Fremantle. In ethically, socially and environmentally responsible architecture where you are part of a small cohort of creative, critical–thinking students, embedded in architectural practice.
The strength of this program lies in its unique combination of the following:
a small diverse cohort
high-quality teaching approaches
tailored practice placements
socio-spatial design studios that tackle contemporary issues
working within a studio-based, creative-practice research culture
situated and engaged within the Fremantle community.
The Design Studio is the central component of the curriculum where you apply your knowledge, creativity and strategic problem-solving skills in the design of built environments.
During practice placements, you apply your professional and technical learning in local practices under the supervision of a Registered Architect.
The curriculum focusses on diverse graduate employment opportunities and is mapped to the Australian National Standard of Competency for Architects.  In addition to gaining professional competencies, you develop highlevel strategic research agility, resourcefulness and design innovation that opens up opportunities within traditional and non-traditional career pathways.
The personal experience of studying architecture at the Fremantle Campus is enhanced by the historic, artistic and architectural context of the city. Within the program there are opportunities to undertake studies in the Kimberley, Sydney and overseas.","School of Arts & Sciences, Fremantle Campus
