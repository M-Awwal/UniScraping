Intensive Mode Delivery is a compact and time efficient way to complete a postgraduate qualification with minimal impact on professional and personal lifestyles. Subjects are generally delivered in either standard intensive or mixed mode. Standard Intensive delivery is generally scheduled over two weekends during the semester with two sets of three-day sessions per subject, usually scheduled Thursday to Saturday (approximately six to eight contact hours per day) with a break of four or five weeks between session one and session two of each subject. Mixed mode subjects will include a mixture of compulsory online activities and on-campus workshops. International students are required to be on campus every week. This mode of delivery will not impact the duration of the degree length. “I studied both my undergraduate and postgraduate degree at Bond University. I completed a Bachelor of Communication, majoring in Advertising and Journalism. I also completed a Master of Arts, majoring in Corporate Communication and Public Relations. I decided to study at Bond, due to the ability to fast track my degrees and the small size of the university. I also loved the tight knit community! Show more “I studied both my undergraduate and postgraduate degree at Bond University. I completed a Bachelor of Communication, majoring in Advertising and Journalism. I also completed a Master of Arts, majoring in Corporate Communication and Public Relations. I decided to study at Bond, due to the ability to fast track my degrees and the small size of the university. I also loved the tight knit community! The best thing about studying at Bond is definitely the people, from the teachers to students and staff, the people are amazing. During my time at Bond, I met some of the greatest people from all over the world and created a close network. My experience at Bond was incredible! I lived on campus for the duration of my two degrees and from the moment I moved in, it felt like home. There was always something to do if I was not studying, like joining one of the great clubs on campus and meeting new people. When I first started at Bond, I was fortunate to meet a number of students who were partway through their degree and who have become friends and future contacts for my business. I completed a number of internships while at Bond, which were extremely helpful. For example, I interned in Singapore for one of the largest advertising agencies, Bond even allowed me to take the internship as a subject in my degree. Bond also helped me secure an internship in Melbourne through a previous student. I managed to organise several other internships independently and although Bond did not source these, they were extremely supportive and assisted me in every aspect. Since graduating from Bond I have founded two businesses. I am the Co-Founder/Director of the app ‘Be There Beauty’ and the Founder/Director of the social media management business, ‘So Social Australia’. Bond equipped me for these roles as I gained skills throughout my degrees that prepared me for the real world. Bond allowed me to connect with other previous students from around the world who also run their own business. Although I may not have known them while I was studying, the network that Bond has established helped me greatly. The main difference between Bond and other universities is that Bond is like a family. The Bond community supports each other during your studies and every day after. Everyone you meet is so nice and genuinely wants to keep in contact and remain part of the community. Attending Bond for two degrees was some of the best times of my life and I want to go back in the future to study, I wouldn’t go anywhere else after going to Bond. I would certainly recommend Bond to anyone and I do on a regular basis. It is a world-class institution that allows you to fast-track your degree, and start working and using the skills you have gained.  The first month at Bond I learnt skills I use every day at work. The teachers and fellow students are incredible and helped and continue to shape the reason why Bond is a fantastic university.

Project integration, scope, schedule, cost, risk, quality, resource, communications, procurement, stakeholder and, looking forward, environmental management reflect the generic knowledge areas that combine to support successful project implementation and social responsibility. A hands-on (learning by doing) approach is adopted within a flipped classroom delivery strategy to link theory with practice and deal with project change in real-time. A key outcome for students is being able to evaluate how project managers can determine whether they have been successful (in terms of planned versus actual performance) by ensuring that the project is delivered within budget, on time, as specified, and with no surprises. Students demonstrate competency in project integration management, in particular, by preparing a detailed project plan for an authentic case study with the help of a personal 'coach' to provide individual direction and advice throughout the process.",SSUD71-403: Project Resource Planning,"1. Show competency in project schedule and resource management
2. Manage high performance project teams.
3. Evaluate the characteristics of an effective project manager.
4. Practise scheduling in the context of resource allocation and levelling.
5. Show emotional intelligence in human resource management contexts.","The two most commonly identified critical success factors for projects are an appropriately involved and supportive sponsor and an experienced and people-savvy project manager who understands what it takes to create a performance-focused culture. This subject emphasises the people (soft) skills of project management and the qualities of effective project leadership and communication, including emotional intelligence. These comprise leadership maturity, advocacy, strategic awareness, executive presence and project planning skills. Specific topics explore the interaction between project time and human resource management, such as high-performance teams, resource planning and productivity, resource allocation and levelling using industry-leading software, ethical behaviour, positive project-corporate politics, stakeholder engagement, influence and persuasion, the art of negotiation and compromise, and conflict management. The application of 'Agile' project management is also introduced and compared to traditional project planning frameworks.",SSUD71-305: Project Portfolio and Program Management,"1. Show competency in project communications and stakeholder management.
2. Apply earned value management techniques to assess project performance.
3. Make recommendations regarding strategic portfolio and program alignment.
4. Develop processes for project administration, review and reporting.
5. Explore organisational communications from a stakeholder perspective.","Program management is the coordinated management of multiple related projects designed to implement strategies and deliver specific benefits, while portfolio management is a process for selection and prioritisation of projects and programs within an organisation. In both cases, considerable strategic awareness and judgement is needed. This subject therefore focuses on the monitoring and control of project or program delivery in the context of communications and stakeholder management and their alignment to organisational goals. In addition, students are exposed to the principles and application of program and portfolio management including project administration, project dashboards, earned value management, and the role that a project or program office can play in assisting control processes. A necessarily practical approach is taken to explore this area. The roles and responsibilities of the various professional associations that guide the future development of the global discipline and bear on personal career development are also examined.",SSUD71-111: Project Finance and Procurement,"1. Show competency in project cost and procurement management
2. Examine capital budgeting techniques and decision-making
3. Design a procurement solution including feasibility study and budget
4. Develop a financing plan for managing project cash flow requirements
5. Explore case studies highlighting different project scenarios","A robust understanding of finance and procurement is vital to successful project delivery. This subject examines financing and procurement management of projects, with particular emphasis on the initiation phase, using a range of international case studies drawn from both public and private sectors. The financing component includes the design, structuring, costing, sourcing and management of project finance, credit risk analysis, the cost of capital, principles of financial accounting, capital structure, markets and securitisation. The procurement component includes different types of contractual arrangements, responsibilities and appropriate organisational structures, solicitation planning, governance, the process of feasibility analysis, bid design and selection criteria, setting of a project budget and cost baseline, and implications for contract administration and contract close-out. Together, finance and procurement management ensure the ‘right project’ is selected and that client/sponsor satisfaction and value for money are ultimately delivered.",SDCM71-323: Expert Witness and Dispute Resolution,"1. Show competency in project quality and environmental management.
2. Explore continuous process improvement strategies for avoiding disputes.
3. Specify quality and/or environmental standards in a contractual setting.
4. Prepare or critique an expert report based on a dispute over standards.
5. Demonstrate an understanding of legal recourse to conflict on projects.","Project participants need to understand the legal context within which they make decisions and perform actions, as frequently disputes can arise that require resolution and/or expert opinion. Project quality and environmental management provide a convenient instance where disputes and the need for expert testimony can arise, and are examined here in the context of project closure, including lessons learnt, standards, continuous improvement and client satisfaction. A general appreciation of international legal principles informed by case law forms an important backdrop to the subject. Practitioners must understand the limitations of their involvement in legal proceedings and be familiar with the conduct of procedures that commonly take place, including alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation. A moot court environment is used to demonstrate the experience of appearing in a formal hearing, and students are asked to also prepare or critique an expert report related to an example of ‘defective’ work or service that is the subject of a contractual dispute.",SDIM71-201: Risk Management,"1. Show competency in project scope and risk management;
2. Make scope decisions in the face of uncertainty;
3. Apply techniques for risk identification, analysis and treatment;
4. Demonstrate the treatment of risk in strategic business decision-making;
5. Gain insight into the scientific assessment of project execution risks.","Making effective decisions in the context of uncertainty is vital to all aspects of a project's life cycle. This subject explores the link between project scope and risk management with particular emphasis on the implementation (executing) phase of delivery. A comprehensive study of the identification, measurement, pricing and management of risks encountered in delivering large and complex projects is fundamental to the level of project performance. Key topics include: mitigation and contingency planning; dealing with uncertainty; disaster planning and recovery; risk identification, management and communication; change management (including scope change and creep); emergent risks; use and development of risk registers; use of risk software; and organisational risk management systems (including human safety). A novel simulation game is employed to test students ability to exercise good judgement in realistic life and death scenarios. The importance of proper scope definition, change and validation to maximise stakeholder satisfaction are reinforced via case studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Project quality and environmental management provide a convenient instance where disputes and the need for expert testimony can arise, and are examined here in the context of project closure, including lessons learnt, standards, continuous improvement and client satisfaction. A general appreciation of international legal principles informed by case law forms an important backdrop to the subject. Practitioners must understand the limitations of their involvement in legal proceedings and be familiar with the conduct of procedures that commonly take place, including alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration and mediation. A moot court environment is used to demonstrate the experience of appearing in a formal hearing, and students are asked to also prepare or critique an expert report related to an example of ‘defective’ work or service that is the subject of a contractual dispute.",SDIM71-201: Risk Management,"1.

Project integration, scope, schedule, cost, risk, quality, resource, communications, procurement, stakeholder and, looking forward, environmental management reflect the generic knowledge areas that combine to support successful project implementation and social responsibility. A hands-on (learning by doing) approach is adopted within a flipped classroom delivery strategy to link theory with practice and deal with project change in real-time. A key outcome for students is being able to evaluate how project managers can determine whether they have been successful (in terms of planned versus actual performance) by ensuring that the project is delivered within budget, on time, as specified, and with no surprises. Students demonstrate competency in project integration management, in particular, by preparing a detailed project plan for an authentic case study with the help of a personal 'coach' to provide individual direction and advice throughout the process.",SSUD71-111: Project Finance and Procurement,"1.

In both cases, considerable strategic awareness and judgement is needed. This subject therefore focuses on the monitoring and control of project or program delivery in the context of communications and stakeholder management and their alignment to organisational goals. In addition, students are exposed to the principles and application of program and portfolio management including project administration, project dashboards, earned value management, and the role that a project or program office can play in assisting control processes. A necessarily practical approach is taken to explore this area.

Foundational views of world governance include those of the United Nations system, the idea of governance through a hegemon (now contested for the USA), and the concert of powers as an expression of a multipolar distribution of power.  Recent multilateral approaches factor in corporate, non-government and civil society sectors of activity. Distinctive conceptual models are assessed, including integrative regionalism (exemplified by the EU), actor-networks (as indicated by global city interactions), areas of governance innovation (orbital space, AI and digital norms), plus alternative forms of civilisational and popular representation. Having examined these concepts, students are then able to consider their application to selected global issues.

Whether they’re on campus or abroad, all students will be able to access Bond’s exceptional and personalised learning experience through dynamic and interactive lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops and lab sessions. The world of project management is changing. Projects and programs are increasingly creative in nature, embedding innovative thinking, and dealing with complex business environments. Disruption and change management are becoming normal. A ‘management by projects’ approach, based on interdisciplinary team collaboration, is well suited to complex and / or innovative endeavours and is redefining hierarchical structures of corporate governance in the new gig economy. Innovation in project management, including adaptable practices (such as 'Agile' methodologies) that can respond quickly to opportunities, exploration of alternative solutions and the freedom to experiment, requires a new approach that is not constrained by conventional ideologies and the fear of failure. The parallel processes of innovation management and project management need to interact, new ways of working need to be applied where time is of the essence, and the benefits of design thinking within a diverse team environment must be realised. Innovation is an opportunity for project managers relating to their role in the initiate, implement or influence phases of the life cycle, especially for complex projects. It requires cross-disciplinary approach using creative and entrepreneurial skills and blending financial, social, political and environmental criteria to realise value for project stakeholders. It is a new way of thinking, and a desire to measure success not just in the delivery of projects but also taking account of good design and end-user delight. Projects must be progressive and generate collective utility. The Master of Project Innovation is designed to enhance graduate capabilities to meet future challenges in professional practice and up-skill knowledge over time. Dealing with increased project complexity and the risks of unforeseen consequences and impacts requires that the management of projects adopt a broader (systems thinking) approach. Project innovation is considered to be the next big thing for the project management discipline. Digital badges are growing in popularity for those already in the workforce and looking to up-skill or extend upon and formalise their skills, qualifications and experience. They are awarded to graduates of Project Innovation programs who have achieved at least a credit in a designated pair of core subjects, as shown below. Each digital badge represents an emerging career specialisation (i.e. professional role) related to the wider project management discipline. The subject International Project Management is delivered in the form of a 10-day overseas study tour. Flight and accommodation expenses are at no additional cost to the student. Students should budget approximately $600 for food and other out-of-pocket expenses.
